## Fourth Contemplation: Elements of Alchemy

Having gotten a hard awesome workout in the previous Contemplation, this one is more contemplative, and you assume a meditative physical posture.  Turn your mind inward to your body and see all five of the elements here: water in most of our bodies, earth in our bones, air you breathe in,  fire in the use of oxygen from air to liberate chemical energy from food which then leads to flow of ions through the water.  These five elements are in your body everywhere!  See them.  For specific details on the alchemy symbols, look them up--it's a vast subject.
