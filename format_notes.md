# Format notes

June 4, 2016, UAA library.  

Looking at books to see formats I like, I think the metallurgy stuff is great.  Specifically Non-Metallic Mineral Products by W. S. Bayley from 1930. It appears to be 6X9 format.  34 lines per page, 9 words per line, justified both right and left, indent but no blank space for paragraphs.  TN145.B3.  Hardcover, green.  all headings and titles are in ALL CAPS. Both the headings and the main text are all serifed fonts.  figures follow the margins exactly at their outermost limits.  margins are kind of large, I don't have a ruler to measure.  500 pages.  about 150,000 words, minus some figures.

Another good format model is The Secrets of Triangles by Posamentier and Lehmann.  QA531.P67 2012
serifs on the main text, sans serif for all the headings and titles, (all caps).  about 30 lines per page, 13 words per line, 300 pages, or 110,000 words or so.  But its so many figures and they're so huge that the word count is probably MUCH lower.  size clearly a bit bigger than 6x9, maybe by 1/2 to 3/4 of an inch on each dimension. glossy hardcover.  

From reading about book formats on Lulu, I think Garamond is the right font for main text for me.  Garamond 12 point.  6x9.  What margins?  1 inch left and right and bottom and 1.5 inches top with chapter name and number and page number at top.  Perhaps the free Futura book font is the sans serif heading and title font.
