# What is a Motor?

# Motors and impedance Transformers

Rail against gears here, why gears are used everywhere and how it's part of a military industrial religious system.  

# Linear Driver: The building block

# Resonance and Feedback

1. Fire up the resonator and resonate everything
2. look at the graphs in the resonator, including bringdown
3. understand Q, f, omega based on graphs and feedback and bringdown 
4. study resonant vibrator

# Rotational Motion
![image](images/Anarchist_back_cat.jpg =100x) 

1. Some discussion of bearings, various examples, build a little cart that can roll around out of sticks and wires
2. use resonant vibrator to drive cart around, very simplest robot with directional control 
3. build the pair of double coils with reversible drive, use it to take a free magnet and rotate it step by step, with the buttons going to the next step in one direction or the other
4. put it together with a bearing, repeat experiment
5. run the spin with button version, with knob to set speed
6. use motor to drive wheels of little cart, most basic robot with wheels
7. build a coil winding machine, wind coils, show video of building a coil winding machine with a coil winding machine
8. create "dumb" rotational motor, discuss scaling


# Pumps

1. move a membrane in a pump like way very slowly
2. build the simple wood or plastic pump structure
3. add membrane, build driver stick and magnet unit
4. build fully working water pump, run around and pump water
