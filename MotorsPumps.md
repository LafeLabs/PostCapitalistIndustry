1. build the latest versions of the various boards and test them
2. build the generic new version of the driver on a stick, really go to town with it, make more youtubes of that
3. build rotational motor with new driver board and 4 coils set up in 2 circuits, making a crude stepper motor configuration, with duct tape and sticks
4. build a cart made from sticks, get it to roll around
5. drive the cart with the rotational motor
6. steer the cart with a vibrational resonant motor
7. connect left, right, and forward motors on the cart to the pi via the control boards, prove that can control it all
8. remote login to the pi over local network from laptop and from command line tell the robot how to move, whole thing run off of 4 rechargable AA's
9. get the pi to be controlled over network using a smart phone, control the robot with a phone, document on youtube
10. use rotational motor to make coil winding machine
11. go out on a bike hunting for trash electronics, find coils, make adapter clamp for coil winder to unwind salvaged coils
12. make a coil winding supply chain video
13. find an amp from a car radio that can work for the dummy board control, figure out how to hack it to control the coil, put it all in a tutorial
14. build a dummy pump motion thing without fluids
15. build actual fluid pump, test it
16. document all this, use phone to analyze data on it, ipythons for all of it
17. more data documentation and ipytyons and howtos
18. make hopping and walking and running little bopper robots, control with phone, get them to talk to each other, control the RUMBLE with the phone
19. make the cheapest simplest swimming robot ever
20. build up a set of everything motor related, big stock, spimes
21. build up a set of generators to charge AA batteries and capacitors, and capacitors to smooth the charging of AAs
22. scale down the pumps, start working toward fractal reactors

Definitly if plastic bottles are going to be a huge part of the tehcnology, include the electrostatic motor and generators that can be built easily using a plastic bottle rotor.

# What is a Motor?

# Motors and impedance Transformers

Rail against gears here, why gears are used everywhere and how it's part of a military industrial religious system.  

# Linear Driver: The building block

# Resonance and Feedback

1. Fire up the resonator and resonate everything
2. look at the graphs in the resonator, including bringdown
3. understand Q, f, omega based on graphs and feedback and bringdown 
4. study resonant vibrator

# Rotational Motion
![image](images/Anarchist_back_cat.jpg =100x) 

1. Some discussion of bearings, various examples, build a little cart that can roll around out of sticks and wires
2. use resonant vibrator to drive cart around, very simplest robot with directional control 
3. build the pair of double coils with reversible drive, use it to take a free magnet and rotate it step by step, with the buttons going to the next step in one direction or the other
4. put it together with a bearing, repeat experiment
5. run the spin with button version, with knob to set speed
6. use motor to drive wheels of little cart, most basic robot with wheels
7. build a coil winding machine, wind coils, show video of building a coil winding machine with a coil winding machine
8. create "dumb" rotational motor, discuss scaling


# Pumps

1. move a membrane in a pump like way very slowly
2. build the simple wood or plastic pump structure
3. add membrane, build driver stick and magnet unit
4. build fully working water pump, run around and pump water


 pump and tubes can all be from plastic bottle parts cut and then welded back together.  magnets fully inside the plastic tube, tethered to the sides but free to move, driving plastic pushers to make peristaltic pumping action.  All the different kinds of vibrational motion can be done with plastic mechanical oscillators, which could drive air very fast with plastic bottle hing resonators.  vacuum pumps, air pumps, water pumps, all can be built from plastic bottles.  I have been thinking way too much about how to deal with solid blocks of poured or molded thermo plastic when there are existing materials in the form of bottles that are EVERYWHERE and which can make good plumbing and mechanical parts at absurdly low weightes.  A universal pump that can be built from pop bottles, coils of wire and magnets would be huge, definitely should be a component of basic trash wizard kit.
