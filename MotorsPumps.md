Definitly if plastic bottles are going to be a huge part of the tehcnology, include the electrostatic motor and generators that can be built easily using a plastic bottle rotor.

# What is a Motor?

# Motors and impedance Transformers

Rail against gears here, why gears are used everywhere and how it's part of a military industrial religious system.  

# Linear Driver: The building block

Need to get this simpler.  Class D amplifiers salvaged from car radios.  Also simpler system that can be hand soldered from parts without a board.  Need to model this in 3d, then lay it out on a rock with epoxy, then solder, then use a lower temp heat gun to wrap in plastic.  

THIS IS A GREAT ARCHITECTURE!!!!  rocks, JB weld, solder paste, samtec connectors to connect to the world, and wrapped in plastic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1111111111

BUILD this now!!!!!!! JB Weld goes to 260 C so if that goes on first, then I use 230 C to melt the solder paste, then 130 C to melt on the plastic.  

# Resonance and Feedback

1. Fire up the resonator and resonate everything
2. look at the graphs in the resonator, including bringdown
3. understand Q, f, omega based on graphs and feedback and bringdown 
4. study resonant vibrator

# Rotational Motion
![image](images/Anarchist_back_cat.jpg =100x) 

1. Some discussion of bearings, various examples, build a little cart that can roll around out of sticks and wires
2. use resonant vibrator to drive cart around, very simplest robot with directional control 
3. build the pair of double coils with reversible drive, use it to take a free magnet and rotate it step by step, with the buttons going to the next step in one direction or the other
4. put it together with a bearing, repeat experiment
5. run the spin with button version, with knob to set speed
6. use motor to drive wheels of little cart, most basic robot with wheels
7. build a coil winding machine, wind coils, show video of building a coil winding machine with a coil winding machine
8. create "dumb" rotational motor, discuss scaling


# Pumps

1. move a membrane in a pump like way very slowly
2. build the simple wood or plastic pump structure
3. add membrane, build driver stick and magnet unit
4. build fully working water pump, run around and pump water


 pump and tubes can all be from plastic bottle parts cut and then welded back together.  magnets fully inside the plastic tube, tethered to the sides but free to move, driving plastic pushers to make peristaltic pumping action.  All the different kinds of vibrational motion can be done with plastic mechanical oscillators, which could drive air very fast with plastic bottle hing resonators.  vacuum pumps, air pumps, water pumps, all can be built from plastic bottles.  I have been thinking way too much about how to deal with solid blocks of poured or molded thermo plastic when there are existing materials in the form of bottles that are EVERYWHERE and which can make good plumbing and mechanical parts at absurdly low weightes.  A universal pump that can be built from pop bottles, coils of wire and magnets would be huge, definitely should be a component of basic trash wizard kit.  
 
 floating rotors, both floating in water and floating in air with magnetic levitation, tiny turbo pumps, juts a few mm across. Maybe electrostatic motors make sense for tiny turbo pumps. Must have sub mm scale UHV technology.
 
 the plastic bearing with the mild cartons, shave to a point at each end a 1 cm rod from a plastic curtain rod, put dimples in sheets of HDPE from milk bottle with hot air gun and a pushing tool of some kind like a stick.  These get welded together at the ends and you have a spring loaded bearing/shaft/seat combination made out of all plastic. This can have the spool built into it with some more plastic welding, making the spooling stepper motor for the xyz manipulators.  
 
 Once these work, I'll also want biomimetic arms with the push/pull cable motors driving like tendons, arms come in from all sides, an xyz bang boom manipulator moves the object around.  Put a milk bottle in, fix it to the weighted bang booms, and run the program on all the various arms and move the object around as needed to do the work.  
 
 Another important pump and fluidic architecture is with wood.  This could be carved dead wood but also living wood, where the electrical and chemical systems are integrated into the living tree.  The can be topped with a variety of polymers, including silicone or various plastic or rubber sheets. Does it have to be totally water proof?  no.  The top can simply have a high enough flow impedance that flow through it is limited.  This can be useful especially when the whole thing is immersed in water.  fluid can be pumped with some loss with a permeable cloth, also slowly exchanging ions from the surrounding water.  
 
 This wood carving process is vastly superior to plastics.  It can be done quickly by hand with sticks which are everywhere, no  need to even find special trash.  Can the EC probe be used to change how wood grows in a living tree to bio-engineer the wood into the desired shape?  Maybe.  Must attempt to interact root growth with EC probe under microscope in water ASAP.  
 
 I need an electric wood carving tool, based on the concept of a Dremel tool but modified for this kind of work, and lower power.  Given that I am now making all my electronic circuits out of wood also, this automatically integrates the chemical and electrical sides of the Project.  Fluidic transistors and oscillators and gates and detectors can be integrated with all sorts of electronic components.
 
 First pump demo is now a stick, carved, with HDPE and duct tape and magnets to pump water.  Sticks, duct tape, coils, transistors, magic stick, magnets, simple.
