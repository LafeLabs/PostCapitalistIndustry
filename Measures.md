I want to say a few words about the way we will measure the world around us while building this technology.

for each of these, talk about units used, orders of magnitude, conversions, meaning, and how to measure, typical values of things

1. mass
2. position, with or without direction
3. velocity and speed
4. acceleration
5. rotation
6. force
7. mass flow
8. charge
9. charge flow(current)
10. voltage
11. energy
12. impedance
13. volume, density
14. inductance
15. capacitance
16. resistance
17. spring constant


It looks on examinign this that I need a resonator chapter, right after motors, when the motor has been built and testing is happening.  Need to get ideas of Q and damping in, real and imaginary Z.
