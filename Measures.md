I want to say a few words about the way we will measure the world around us while building this technology.

for each of these, talk about units used, orders of magnitude, conversions, meaning, and how to measure, typical values of things

1. mass
2. position, with or without direction
3. velocity and speed
4. acceleration
5. rotation
6. force
7. mass flow
8. charge
9. charge flow(current)
10. voltage
11. energy
12. impedance
13. volume, density
14. inductance
15. capacitance
16. resistance
17. spring constant


It looks on examinign this that I need a resonator chapter, right after motors, when the motor has been built and testing is happening.  Need to get ideas of Q and damping in, real and imaginary Z.  

### Start with Mass

What is mass?  How do we measure it? Why do we care?  Mass represents how much of something there is in an object.  Everything I deal with in this work will either be some sort of massless field like the field around a magnet, or various objects and substances made up of atoms.  In the case of the former it mostly does not make sense to talk about mass.  In the case of the latter the total mass can generally be thought of as the number of atoms times how heavy each atom is.  We can think of an atom as a sun-like nucleus surrounded by a cloud of probability that describes the location of electrons on the outside.  The nucleus is made up of positively charged protons and neutral neutrons

If we ignore the electrons it always make a much smaller than 0.1% difference and they can be ignored.
