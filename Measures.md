In order to wield the magic of Trash, we must be able to measure the world around us, and all the beautiful trash we find there.  This is the Trash Magic version of what is normally called "metrology", the science of measurement.  Just as capitalist metrology is often built on the needs of business for measurement and the ability of private business to be able to  build the tools needed, our metrology will be based on our ability to use Trash Magic to do it, and to do the things that Trash Wizards and Trash Witches will need in order to wield their magic.  This means that while our units will be based on theirs initially, we might end up with our own global infrastructure for construction and preservation of units, which could well lead to new definitions.  

The metrological structures we deal with in today's capitalist world are a direct product of the French Revolution.  At that time, the Metric System, also knows as the Systeme Internationale, or SI, was part of a  revolution in culture where a set of universal ideals were to guide measurement, freeing the people from the decrees of kings and other absolute rulers.  While this revolutionary spirit was a powerful positive force in some ways in its day, I believe that the spirit of the French Revolution helped create an overly mechanistic culture that has become far too divorced from the physical reality of the human body.  One reason I like Fahrenheit for instance is that 100 degrees is what feels very hot to a human being and 0 is very cold.  If you get below 0 or above 100 you're pretty far outside the normal range that people want to be in.  I find that to be very reasonable for weather, especially since weather is so poorly predicted or measured that using a more official standard temperature might not make sense.  

So Trash Magic Metrology is partly a revolt against the dehumanizing ideals of the French Revolution.  We revel in the fact that the basic time unit, the second, is comparable to a normal human heart beat.  We like that a meter is about half as tall as a tall person.  The French pushed very hard the other way, in the peak of revolutionary fervor trying to go to a decimal day, trying to force humans into what I view as a more machine-driven mode of existence.  It is interesting that so many of the loudest and most articulate critics of our modern mechanized capitalist order have always been French.  Could it be that this is because of the dynamics of that revolution they've been faced with a monstrous machine the longest?  

I don't mean to denigrate the great work done by those who have built up the SI over the lest few centuries.  It's amazing!  I believe that there is a place for duplicating the atomic clock, the Watt balance, and various other amazing feats of measurement science in the post apocalyptic waste land that future Trash Magicians will live in.  However, as we re-build all that from Trash, there will inevitably be a lot of changes that are made in approach.  

Today we live in a world where just about everyone on Earth is connected to a cellular data network that is synchronized off of atomic time such that we all are connected on the same exact time to a few parts per billion of accuracy.  But how horrible is that?!  What monstrous inhumanity we force on our fellow people by forcing workers to stop work to eat at exactly the same time across many days' journey from each other!  And yet, while time is regimented to 8 digits across our whole species, our medical tests remain some of those with the worst metrology.  When life and death literally hang in the balance, as your blood is measured in various ways that need to be responded to quickly by medical personnel, we get crappy for profit companies charging too much money for slow, inaccurate tests.  Could large numbers of infinite-zero cost fluidics systems not just make medical tests fast and free, but make them better?  I believe so.  And should we build that before we figure out how to build a cesium atomic clock out of trash?  Probably, yes.  

The first thing to talk about is distance.  I believe that it makes sense to use several units for this, both SI(metric) and English.  The base SI unit is the meter, which is a little over 3 feet.  The official SI definition is based on the speed of light and the definition of a second.  So a meter is how far light goes in one light second.  Which is a circular definition, but not a useless one.  Light goes at about 1 foot per nanosecond(a billionth of a second), so 1 meter is how far it goes in about 3 nanoseconds.  

This immediately can be considered in the context of Trash Wizard technology.  We will use various smart phone related technologies in our stuff which have computers with clocks that run at 1 GHz or above.  At that speed, each clock cycle only takes a nanosecond or less.  So if your phone puts out a signal that bounces across the room to some robot and back, say about 30 feet, a whole 30 clock cycles can run on your computer while the signal is out bouncing around!  Note also that this speed will be slower if your "light" is in some material, such as radio signals going down a coaxial cable with teflon in it.  The factor is usually about 40% lower than the normal speed, so rather than going a foot in a nanosecond your signal in coax might go about 8 inches.  

One way to relate distance to time and light is to make radio resonances that you can measure.  This can be done by melting marshmallows or chocolate with some sort of high power microwave radiation gun with a resonant cavity.  However that is both cumbersome, potentially dangerous, and not very accurate.  For most every day measurements you want a ruler for your Trash Magic Stick, possibly a simple set of calipers and/or micrometer, and various parts of your own body.  The body based measurements I find the most useful are the "wingspan" measurement, where you measure a rope, cable, or chain by pulling it out across your full span from outstretched hand to outstretched hand, and repeating and counting, and multiplying by that distance.  For a lot of people that's around 6 feet, also known as a fathom, also known as two yards.  Then there are paces, which are typically about a yard, or 3 feet or half a fathom.  Many charts in the United States use fathoms for depths.  The ability to measure out a number of fathoms quickly in a small space with a rope, chain or wire is useful for doing quick depth measurements.  

For parts where inches and mm are relevant, I favor using all the metric units from micron to mm to cm to m to km, as well as the "mil" or thousandth of an inch, the inch, foot, yard, fathom, and mile.  A VERY IMPORTANT conversion to know is that just as 2.54 cm is an inch, 25.4 microns is a mil, or thousandth of an inch.  One micron is a slang term for micrometer, which is one millionth of a meter.  A hair or fur is generally between 50 and 250 microns thick.  There are 1000 microns to the mm.  

Note also that the original legal definition of the meter that came out of the French Revolution was "1 ten millionth of the distance from the equator to the North Pole".  Or something to that effect.  So the Earth was the universal measuring stick, and to calibrate that, epic adventures were had to go do trigonometry over many degrees of latitude change, mostly in the middle of a war zone.   Awesome.  

The next quantity I want to talk about is mass.  Mass is the property an object has that gives it momentum and responds to gravitational force.  When a force is applied to an object, mass is what determines how fast it accelerates(how much the speed speeds up, the speed of the speed).  The way I most want to deal with mass in Trash Magic is by converting from volume using densities.  Density is the amount of mass an object has per unit of volume.  Volume has units of distance cubed, or distance times distance time distance.  

The most commonly useful volume units to the trash witch are the milliliter and liter.  The thing that's so great about these is that they're a cubic centimeter and cubic deciliter, respectively.  So that makes it easy to convert between volume and distance units.  You can easily imagine a bunch of cubes, 1 cm on a side, being stacked up to make some object, and the number of those blocks is the volume in ml.  If a thing fits in about a 10 cm on a side cube, it's about a liter.  

Now for densities, there are roughly 4 I will reference the most.  At the lightest end is air, which has about 1 kg mass of air per cubic meter.  A cubic meter is 1000 liters.  Next up is water, which has a density of about 1000 times that of air.  So about 1 gram per ml, as opposed to 1 mg per ml for air.  A lot of things are the same as water! Most parts of most organisms' bodies, both animal and plant, including us, are similar in density to water.  So for estimating physics with your own body, assuming it's about 1 g/ml is pretty good for getting started.

### Start with Mass

What is mass?  How do we measure it? Why do we care?  Mass represents how much of something there is in an object.  Everything I deal with in this work will either be some sort of massless field like the field around a magnet, or various objects and substances made up of atoms.  In the case of the former it mostly does not make sense to talk about mass.  In the case of the latter the total mass can generally be thought of as the number of atoms times how heavy each atom is.  We can think of an atom as a sun-like nucleus surrounded by a cloud of probability that describes the location of electrons on the outside.  The nucleus is made up of positively charged protons and neutral neutrons

If we ignore the electrons it always make a much smaller than 0.1% difference and they can be ignored.
