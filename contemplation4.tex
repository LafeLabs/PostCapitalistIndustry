\subsection{Fourth Contemplation: Elements of
Alchemy}\label{fourth-contemplation-elements-of-alchemy}

Having gotten a hard awesome workout in the previous Contemplation, this
one is more contemplative, and you assume a meditative physical posture.
Turn your mind inward to your body and see all five of the elements
here: water in most of our bodies, earth in our bones, air you breathe
in, fire in the use of oxygen from air to liberate chemical energy from
food which then leads to flow of ions through the water. These five
elements are in your body everywhere! See them. For specific details on
the alchemy symbols, look them up--it's a vast subject.
