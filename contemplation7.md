## Seventh Contemplation: Fractal Fluidics

Find the biggest moving water around.  Find a source of water into that stream.  Follow that back to a smaller source, etc, until you are staring at little drops of water.  Look back on the route you've come along and color this in abstractly, contemplating the fractal nature of the flow of water throughout the global ecosystem.
