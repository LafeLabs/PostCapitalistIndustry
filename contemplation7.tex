\subsection{Seventh Contemplation: Fractal
Fluidics}\label{seventh-contemplation-fractal-fluidics}

Find the biggest moving water around. Find a source of water into that
stream. Follow that back to a smaller source, etc, until you are staring
at little drops of water. Look back on the route you've come along and
color this in abstractly, contemplating the fractal nature of the flow
of water throughout the global ecosystem.
