## Technology Should be Slimy and Dirty

Look around you.  We are bags of salty dirty water, and we are surrounded by mud and dirty rocks on all sides.  This is the world we live and grow and thrive in.  It's how our food grows, it's how our waste is disposed of, it's how we get our raw materials and how we dispose of our "trash".  

And yet this is not how our technology is.  

Our technology is, instead, obsessed with the clean and "pure".  It is obsessed with order, with perfect rows of things, with straight lines and perfectly geometric circles.  The very structure of all our technology represents our worship of numbers and math and military order, as well as of mining and minerals.  

I will go into more detail on this later, but I believe the structure of the modern micofabricated circuit is a product of the white supremacist ideology of the far right lunatics who started Silicon Valley.  They were, like all of their kind, obsessed with "purity", order, and forcing everyone to march to a perfectly timed clock.  This is borne out in a machine architecture which they pretend is a product of some kind of technical evolution but which is just as much a function of their capitalist religion as the rows of decorative stone columns they out outside their buildings of power.  

If, rather than Evil Machines, we want our technology to be more human and more life like, it should resemble what we see around us in the living world. This means it should be largely filled with and immersed in dirty water.  And should be capable of moving fluids and gasses around at around atmospheric pressure, with simple circulation systems. 

Another key distinction of living systems is that they do not distinguish between material transport, data transport, energy and electrical transport.  All of these involve the flow of ions and various big molecules through fluids.  

Our non-living technical systems crudely split these functions off from one another.  

## What is Fluidics and why do we care?

One type of magic that must be wielded if we expect to have a decent life is potion making.  This means mixing fluids, moving them around with pumps, compressing them, running electricity through them, and also doing things with gasses of various kinds.  This is needed to efficiently compost waste at a high speed safely and to build up plant growth infrastructure fast for food production. It is also where novel chemicals and various life saving drugs come from. 

## clean water 

clean water is CRITICAL, need to research existing tech here, talk about alternatives. 

## Rants about free transistors vs. Fascist Transistors

## from the blog:

The channels in the reactor should not just be able to take water, water should be in them most of the time.  If the reactor is just barely partially submerged in water, it can get power from waves and tide or current in a river or stream, both for generating electricity and as a direct source of hydrostatic pressure to push materials from one “side” of the fractal reactor to “the other”.  I put scare quotes around side and other here because it’s not really going to be arranged as a simple in/out machine, but will have many channels that direct materials around.

Having the channels be filled with water means that robots can be made to be neutrally buoyant or close to it, and propulsion along the channels of the system can be caused with pumps rather than some kind of motor on the actual robot.  Thus a “dead” robot can be directed to a location in the system without being powered up at all, then can park on location where the work is to be done and absorb energy from flowing water to use to do mechanical and/or chemical work on location.

The motion of the water can be used to generate electricity which also splits water into gaseous hydrogen and oxygen.  Pumps could be used to liquify the H2 in some cases as a more dense energy storage medium.  Having oxygen available all the time is useful for chemical reactor chambers because you can use oxygen plasma to clean surfaces in an aggressive way to ready a chamber for a new process. And H2/O2 gas torch can be used for   melting glass and various simple welding and heating tasks.  Finally the re-uniting of the H2 and the O2 will create pure water which is needed for humans and plants.

Just the wave or stream powered desalinator and burner that can run with no intervention is a technology very worth building ASAP.  Running water can turn a turbine that makes DC AC power which is rectified and smoothed to DC, then drives electrolysis, saves it up until a gas reservoir fills, then an electric spark from a step-up transformer from the generator fires, reuniting the O2 and H2  to form pure water, which falls into a water reservoir which can be of arbitrary size.  Over time, this could sit for months building up fresh water very slowly, making it always available in that location.  This must be built!  If it’s possible to use the metals in gas powered cars to build fuel cells, this could be the basis of a primitive hydrogen economy.

In addition to power, locomotion, hydrogen and oxygen, water can provide many other useful chemicals, many of which are unwanted contaminants which will be removed from the water over time.  Ocean water in particular can yield vast chemical wealth from the trash found in the ocean as well as energy from the tides and waves which will be substantial in many places.  Unlike a river, in the ocean one can build out in a 2 dimensional area and always have both energy and materials that scales up with the building.  Why is this relevant? Because this is the future of many coastal cities.  As our climate shifts and sea levels rise, many coastal cities will be flooded.  Some will be rebuilt higher up with landfill, with water pumped and managed like in Amsterdam.  But many will inevitably be abandoned.  This has the potential to be a environmental disaster of its own right, as the many toxic chemicals of a modern city suddenly can flow naturally out of the city.

However it’s also a huge opportunity for the trash wizard to build the means of production.  As the refuse of a dead city first starts to float freely, if fractal reactors and rumbles of robots etc move in fast enough, the entire mineral wealth of the city can be reclaimed into the new system.   Vast, scalable, production of fresh water will enable a huge canopy of vegetation to be grown above the site, using the buildings as a lattice for upward growth to create a green paradise where humans will move from place to place via skylines of various kinds, some manual and some powered by electricity or wind or tide, as well as boats of various kinds.  Storms and floods should be able to be captured in terms of both energy and materials, building up huge amounts of pumped-uphill water as well as hydrogen and oxygen.  In some cases it will make sense to run the reactor as the storm hits to use very high power levels temporarily to complete a large industrial task quickly with the surge in available energy.

I want to make one more point about reactor chambers in the fractal thermoplastic system.  It should be possible to change the shape in situ using the various assembler robots that can carry heated reshaping tools around.  It’s probably easiest to do this in either air or vacuum or some inert gas, but that can always be done because vacuum and gas pumps are ubiquitous in the system.  I think we also need ball valves that are driven by the magnetic motors.    But if you want to do an edit, you can always use fluids to move your robots into place, move them into a fixed position, evacuate the chambers, run flown water through a neighboring location, generate power off that, create heat and motion and use the robots to use melt tools to weld, cut and add plastic to make new shapes, motors and tools.

Three dimensional mater that is made from pure trash and ambient energy which has the power to edit itself.  That is what this technology is pointing toward and I’m not seeing anything that stops it from happening.  Unlike the Drexler/Merkle model of nanotechnology, this fractal approach does not start out nano.  It will be useful immediately, and will continue to be useful(indeed revolutionary) even if the nanotechnology never works.

One more point I want to make is that this technology allows for all sorts of scalable bio-reactors to be built, so that all the advances of biotechnology can be leveraged into our free infrastructure.  Drugs and other very useful chemicals can now be synthesized by genetically brewing with genetically modified organisms in the same way that beer is brewed.  The ability to scalably manipulate liquids should allow for both the development and deployment of genetically modified organisms to brew useful chemicals.  The ability to make drugs and vital nutritional supplements in this factory is critical, and again, is a technology that on its own is worth developing even if the whole rest of this plan didn’t work.  Given the fractal nature of our technology and the fact that it’s immersed in water, organisms of all kinds can flow in and out of it, and be used for many purposes.  A symbiotic relationship can and in fact must be developed between the smart matter technology and the surrounding ecosystem.  Looking just at the flow of atoms, there are lots of atoms that the human body could use to live in ocean water.  Could a system like this produce a food of some kind just from flowing seawater?  Maybe.  With enough energy and time(both of which a patient society has plenty of) it might be possible to live 100% off the ocean.

Obviously human and other animal waste must also be processed in this fractal reactor system.  Again this is a source of incredibly useful atoms.  Just the methane that leaks off from solid waste is like gold for early work on the nano assemblers since it can be used to make 3d carbon nanotechnology electronics and described above.  A living system should be able to digest waste much faster and more safely than the current systems where the only living thing is the one target organism that does the digesting.  And of course the reclamation of chemical wealth in the form of drugs and minerals will also be of huge monetary value in the old economy quickly, creating a ready source of central bank debt wealth for the community who lives off the Reactor in the sea cities.

## another blog post:

In reference to the previous post, on the fractal factory, I have been thinking more about the materials to use.  I have been thinking about silicones for everything.  But why? The basic principles in the previous post will work best with some type of thermoplastic, because that can be done easily with the free metal etching tool to make moulds.  heat, pressure, and a scanned  high voltage welding tool can make layers from any of these types of material.  A scanned heated head could also just make shapes, and of course there are 3d printing techniques.

Here is a list of some thermoplastics:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoplastic

PLA, nylon, ABS, PMMA, HDPE, LDPE, and even teflon can all be used!

Also, the correct way to fabricate arbitrary 3d objects from many layers of thermoplastic is as follows.  First, metal parts are made by a combination of machining, 3d printing, and laser cutting.  These could also be chiseled manually with robotic vibrating parts.  High mechanical impedance vibrating tools with cutting steel and diamond cutting tools chipping like a beaver’s teeth, being moved around with scanned x  y and z motion could cut arbitrary curved surfaces into metal.

All these various metal tools can get picked up by robotic arms and moved around and pushed into a target material, where the metal tools are heated to the correct temperature to reform the plastic.  This allows tools to fall over a range of size.  The same infrastructure can be used to deploy a several cm tool to cut a several cm channel in a big block of plastic, and then micron scale tools also press patterns into other smaller locations.  This scaling of tools means that the fractal nature of the finished product is represented in the fabrication method.

3 dimensional mechanical thermoplastic lithography.  Robots must be built which can carry out tasks with heated tools in various locations and scales.

The task to start fabrication becomes clear.  To start off, metal parts are salvaged of various shapes and sizes, heater wire is wrapped around them with thermometers and temperature regulation, put it on the end of a stick of some kind, and impressions are made in different thermoplastic trash from cars and similar household junk.

Going back to the various motor designs, it should be possible to design the lithography tool set for making the bits out of various thermoplastics to get all the basic motor types to work.  The path to making all these things work keeps getting clearer.  With fluid transistors that can be fabricated with channels in plastics, simple logic gates can be made, as well as various types of control and amplification.  With robots that deploy all shapes and sizes of thermal press tools, it should be possible to make arbitrary 3d fractal channel structures.  This means we have transistors, motors, and pumps.  With the high voltage generator technology working it should be possible to build it out of the fractal trash foam.  Wires can be pulled through channels by rolling robots of all sizes, and they can go into the liquids to connect them.  Wires separated by a small fluid chamber can make a high current transistor.

So the elements that are coming together in this vision are: Rumbles of robots can rip a car apart and make assemblers, motors, processors, energy storage devices, high voltage generators, high current generators, pumps, compressors, and finally more robots.  Plasma and chemicals being pumped and mixed in the plumbing allows for arbitrary synthesis of needed chemicals, machines, tools, and electronics.

Just the fractal robotic fabrication of thermoplastics found in trash is worth pursuing as an isolated technology.  Add that to motors! Chemistry! CVD!  wow! If this works based on even just using piles of trash and heater wires with sticks used by hand, it can be used as a demo for getting funding and doing useful fluidics.

## and another:

One of the layers in the trash wizard technology is microfluidic channels that can move ionized gasses around.  The implications of this should be examined.  Ionized gasses are an essential tool in modern micro fabrication.  With plasma plumbing integrated into everything, all the tools of standard microfab are also integrated.  Thus it could be possible with micro sized plumbing and materials moving vibrational motors and pumps to fabricate electronic components, move them around, physically re-assemble them, and break them down and reform them into other devices.

This can be a path to scalable synthesis of nano devices.  Carbon nanostructures could be built and also positioned by flowing gasses that are used for CVD synthesis through a channel that then defines the position of the structure once it’s fabricate.  Perhaps use of a standard CVD nanotube recipe where the catalytic particles are positioned using the particle movement tools described above, and then where more vibrational motors built into the channel are used to create junctions of various kinds to create arbitrary nonlinear circuits.

In order for all of this to work, we first need to have a scalable fabrication system for making micro fluidic channel circuits with pumps built in that can work for liquids, gasses, and tiny solids.  I believe that a great starting material for this is PDMS.  Unlike some other silicone choices that could be used for the fabrication, PDMS flows with time, temperature, and pressure.  A scanned probe that deforms metal could be used to get a very high resolution shaped surface.  This can then press a sheet of PDMS up against a flat metal plate, and with applied heat and some time a perfect copy of the metal should be made in the PDMS.  This could be done to make a sequence of layers, which can then be stacked and pressed with moderate heat and time to join them without destroying the shape of each layer too much.  Many layers can be added up to make a 3d network of channels.  Some channels will have conducting fluids in them that can control the potential of various high voltages.  High voltages are used, with feedback, to drive various floppy and also springy bits of silicone.  These flaps, fins, spines, rods, pushers, and membranes will act to move fluids, solids, and gasses around the network.

With the ability to move anything to anywhere in the 3d network of silicone, we can connect the whole cube to various input gasses and liquids to do chemical synthesis.  This can also involve various types of chemical and physical vapor deposition on solids that are moved around, connected to high voltages, plasmas, etc.  So arbitrary nonlinear circuits should be able to be built into the superstructure using a variety of technologies, which grow and shift over time(while keeping the PDMS matrix unchanged).  This is very powerful, and justifies a potentially laborious and slow build up of the 3d silicone matrix. If one fabrication run can yield many generations of technology, it can afford to be slow.

Perhaps the first practical step is to build the high voltage generator that is part of trash wizardry.  If we had high voltage, we could start playing with electrostatic motors and also would have a source of high voltage for trying to do scanned probe nano machining of metal surfaces.  The way this generator might work is a mechanical oscillator will be driven by the standard philosophy engine magnet/coil driver, and will have appropriate metal and insulating pointy and not pointy bits that move charge from ground to some isolated electrode.  Experiments with these types of oscillators could begin at any time, and need almost no funding, just time to work on them.  With high voltage working, motors are needed, as well as welding tips.  Then scanned probe weld fabricators are made which are driven by simple electrostatic motors and can make molds for PDMS.  From here, a system is built up for making arbitrary networks, then chemical and physical synthesis is built up.

Another important point about this whole technology system is that it should be fractal scalable.  That is to say, there can be channels and pumps and switches and so on that are as big as meters across in some massive factory block down to 10’s of cm, cm, mm, microns, and finally down to just a few nanometers.  With motors that also scale all the way up to huge movers of many kg solid objects using coils and magnets down to electrostatic drivers that move plasmas around at the 10 nm scale to fabricate new nano materials, it should be possible to take in raw trash, rip it apart fractally, move destructor robots around as needed to keep it all apart and sorting it, and at the end the scale is nanometers both of the input and of the output, which are nanoscale electronic materials. These materials can be moved around on other “sides” from the inputs, scaling back up as needed to create arbitrary technology with nano structured material.

Can this all be built up from cars?  I believe so, as long as some rubber can be found in cars that can work for the synthesis of the infrastructure.  That probably won’t be PDMS, but I believe tire rubber can be made to work with some experimentation.   Fart gas from various animals and hydrogen and oxygen from electrolysis can make a fair number of initial processes to start building up technology with.  This may be the future of domestic cattle: as a source of methane to use as a process gas for fabricating carbon nano electronics.  One can imagine a giant dome tent which channels the methane away from some cows and pumps it into the nano assembly.  Rotting turds can also be used to source methane, which can be huge piles of accumulated dog poo in urban areas.

I’m suddenly contemplating how the many elements should communicate.  I think high voltages turned on and off could be used to create electric dipole sources that can transmit at low frequencies and speeds very easily.  For very low data rates, as a constant baseline, all the elements of the trash wizardry could communicate using high voltage oscillators controlled by high voltage liquid transistors.

Also note that it should be possible to quickly do science to investigate new ways of doing things.  For instance liquid transistors of many different liquids should be able to be very rapidly investigated and instantly deployed after discovery.

It appears that it should be possible to create a totally scalable nanotechnology system that can break down old cars and create arbitrary new nano electronic and mechanical materials, which can create still more factories, made from  the same materials which absorb large and larger numbers of cars, etc, creating exponential consumption of cars until there are no more cars.

all the stuff about the evils of the microprocessor ideology goes here, the white supremacy ideology of William Shockley and how that is reflected in the bad decisions made in developing the modern microchip.  evils of clocks, connection to number worship and monotheism, sparse desert of the processor, evil separations between matter and information and energy
