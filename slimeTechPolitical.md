### What is Fluidics and why do we care?

One type of magic that must be wielded if we expect to have a decent life is potion making.  This means mixing fluids, moving them around with pumps, compressing them, running electricity through them, and also doing things with gasses of various kinds.  This is needed to efficiently compost waste at a high speed safely and to build up plant growth infrastructure fast for food production. It is also where novel chemicals and various life saving drugs come from.
