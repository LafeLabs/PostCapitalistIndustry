Book II can be seen as a series of pieces on building things to study and interact with aspects of the world for industry and art.  Some of those topics are:

1.  magnetic fields from a current carrying wire, coils, permanent magnets, forces, magnetic field vectors, measurement of magnetic susceptibility of different materials 
2.  electric fields in high voltage systems, observation of the field, charge, capacitance, the triboelectric series, Leiden Jar and dielectric constant
3.  study of generalized impedance in all systems, leading up to fluctuation dissipation theorem. mass on spring, vibrating beam, rolling ball in a potential, pendulum, torsional oscillator, water wave, acoustics, flow of fluids through a channel flow of gasses thru a bag(tent study)
4.  split the study of impedance into AC and DC, with a whole section on DC transport? 
5.  study of rotational motion, actually measure moment of inertia and torque in REAL UNITS
6.  post apocalyptic metrology, do all units of the SI from scratch out of trash
7.  generalized RC circuits: study of capacitors, generalized capacitors and resistors like with fluids but also gasses etc.
8.  generalized LR circuits, study of inductances with real measurements
9.  optics study which involves building microscopes from scratch as well as telescopes and optical transducers with audio output to do optical point to point communication and music etc, build lots of guerrilla art on this
10.  robot construction involves more guerrilla installations, building fractal robots that move around inside quadroPOD environments.
11.  fluid dynamics: tesla valve, build and measure, calibrated standards in real units for fluid flow, all the various basic stuff, observe flow with different basic fluidic circuits, build digital math circuits and analog amplifiers 
12.  generalized amplification and negative differential resistance, show gain in many systems with NDR from devices and also feedback, make mechanical amplifiers and electrical amplifiers with dirt based slimezistors
13.  quantum tunneling in beer cans: a study of all possible observable tunneling phenomena in the common beer can using the Ion Magic Sticks, applications study to energy storage
14.  resonance: Q, all the different systems, optics, etc, make art and deploy it
15.  the flywheel: many flywheels, bearings, a detailed study of bearing dynamics in real units, with units found for all the properties of a bearing, make many whirligigs and deploy them in lots of guerrilla art, studies of all the parts of what makes a flywheel or paddle wheel or turbine work well, studies of what's out there in capitalism etc, with real units
16.  fractal scale of mechanical motion: build huge fractals where mechanical work can be done at 10 m down to 10 nm scales using fishing line and rocks and sticks
17.  energy: units, go find it, find more, build installations that move in water and air all over the place, INFINITE USB CHARGERS
18.  Soot noise magic studies, find all the soot and MEASURE IT using noise magic
19.  Electrical Transport measurements with noise magic
20.  A thorough investigation of ion magic for fabrication of electronic components, make wires and connections etc., try many electrolytes and many voltages and so on, different electrodes for positive and negative
21.  plasma ion magic, use of high voltages for ionizing gasses, observation of behavior in various slimezistor tubes
22.  Construction of Skeletron based universal housing: HDPE tents with hard sections and soft joints, use for boat, tent, lab
23.  growing plants on the quadropod , study water and light needs, basic math put together for this for estimates in the future of food needs
24.  study of poop in heated reactors under different conditions of pumped air and vibration, both human and dog and also birds(pigeons or gulls for universality)
25.  broad study of thermal regulation for biological reactions, run biological reactions in temperature stabilized systems of various kinds with controlled hoist and heat source, thermometry, regulation studies, thermodynamics of micro biology 
26.  computation based on simple diodes using dirt and trash, make a binary adder
27.  a study of cooling for human habitation: build cool places and deploy in the world as guerrilla art, build same but for refrigerators, make ammonia cooling, water evaporation cooling, MEASURE it all in REAL UNITS, same with heat exchangers, use underground and underwater pipes to cool a tent with thermal regulation, deploy these in very large number around the world as free stuff 
28.  detailed study of properties of HDPE and LDPE in REAL UNITS: viscosity and temperature, weld joint strength, flow rates, molding, interaction with hot stone, different working tools, BUILD LOTS OF PUBLIC GUERRILLA ART USING PLASTIC, make a 3d(2d+1) fabricator 


Each of these Studies will have a python notebook with all numerical calculations and also real data I took and REAL UNITS and all the equations in LATEX.

Each Study will have a physical artifact that can be gifted to a student for doing the experiment without having to build it the first time(although they should build another as a gift after and pas it all on)

Each artifact will have a version in virtual reality

Each Study will have a ritual to build the Thing, and there will be videos with tales and lore on this subject--more succinctly, each Study has an Artifact and each Artifact always has a tale and a lore in video format for free online. 

full coloring book with ALL STUDIES will exist in standard coloring book form
