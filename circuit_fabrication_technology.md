## Circuit Fabrication Technology

3d circuit fabrication:

1. Sources of electronics technology, how to get it for free, how to identify and sort and use it, database management issues to make sure salvage works
2. 3d manipulator, how it works, plans to build it, simple demonstrations
3. how virtual and augmented reality work to help 3d circuit 
4. 3d circuit fabrication, how my circuit cartoon type schematics works, how the software works to do crowd sourced design off the internet with that
5. spime concept for circuits, how the documentation works, how to expand on it
