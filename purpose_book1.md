### Why Am I writing this book?

This is a manifesto. 
 
From the website [www.manifestos.net](http://www.manifestos.net):

"A manifesto is a public declaration of the purpose, principles, or plan of action of a group or individual."

This book is to be a guide for my work, and eventually for other people's work.  I need to state the general principles, specific design rules for building stuff, and the strategies and tactics that will turn this artistic and technological and scientific project into a successful political movement.
