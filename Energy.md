Plan:

1. Library research with notes to create a accurate introduction, base ipython notebooks on that as I go
2. build the range of energy storage and generation systems
3. imagine and create image of what an ambient energy world looks like
4. go bonkers with heat engines, solar heat, steam etc



# Energy

- mass equivalent
- heat
- radiation, Wien's law, T^4 etc
- force and distance, work
- steam
- oil and the petrocarbon energy cycle and system

is it possible to do a simple nuclear transformation to see energy mass equiv?  Or maybe photo electric effect

ipython notebooks:

1. lots of units
2. E = mc^2
3. oil and coal calculations
4. steam calculations
5. heat calculations with human body, sleeping bag, room, house, various heat losses, use of numbers from insulation at Home Depot

radiation thermometry with trash wizard stick, use the phone to measure radiation temperature of things IR camera 


## Radiation and the sun, hot bodies

## Heat and the Earth

## Energy in the Age of Steam

GO dig into the steam books, taking reference notes, putting together a well researched story, make crude steam engine from trash, do some simple thermo expeeriments 

## Oil and the Petrochemical Energy Cycle

Go read books on this, start to put togehter the global vitalstatistics

## cooling, "coolth", air conditioning, refrigeration, entropy

build:

1. solar heat engines
2. solar thermal regulation of hot tool to work thermo plastics
3. solar steam turbine that drives magnet in coil that makes stored electricity
4. thermal physics demonstrations with hot water and joule heat
5. lots of energy harvesting with wheels: wind, water, different sizes and flow rates
6. high voltage storage systems from direct energy of various kinds
7. vacuum pump based water cooling, measurement, build pumps, measure vacuum 


## Concept of Ambient Energy gets whole Section(of this chapter)

draw the road map from very practical energy harvestors for my robots now to much more grand visions including robots that can go by themselves for hundreds of years, forraging for trash and processing it.  

## How my power system works

I think my power system of choice will be bipolar DC, where unregulated random frequency AC from the environment generally charges a + cap and a - cap, and they alternate driving high R coils from high voltage, with big step up transformer to get 100's of mV up to 10's of V, so like 100:1 step up, maybe 1000 turns and 10 turns.  With a center tap, and one diode on each side, to charge the two caps on alternating halves of the current cycle.  

## Streams and Creeks


I first calculate the kinetic energy of a 10 cm square area of water in a creek.  The density of water is about 1 kg/liter, and 1 liter is (10 cm)^3.  So power is 0.5*v^3 where v is in m/s.  A fast spot in a creek should easily be 12 mph which is about 6 m/s, so the *theoretically available* power is about 100 W in that area.  Thus a efficient generator or set of small generators based on soda bottle water wheels should be able to give a easy steady 100 W with an area of more like 1 foot by 1 foot.  Or it can run 10 hours for every hour of use and put out 1000 W.  For a tidally charged boat this means it should be possible to get a 1:1 charge run ratio, where 10 hours of charge gives 10 hours of running etc.  

To store 100 W of power to be used for 2 hours I need something in the 100's of kJ range of energy storage.  If this is stored at high voltage, say 1000 V with 1 F capacitance in a large electrochemical cell, that's 1 MJ and so that's about right.  Thus I need to build large electrochemical cells that can take 1000 V and have 1 F of capacitance.  Aluminum pop cans in sea water might do the trick.  

Consider the flow rate in kg/s of a creek that is 1 m^2 area and 1-5 m/s.  Thats's 1000-5000 kg/s.  Now suppose that this much water drops 1 meter in a second, that's going to be 10 to 50 kW.  Similar to a gas generator and easily enough for a substantial factory location with a few people building a few things at a time.  10 people, each using 1 kW at a time to do work is a lot of work, as long as there is a sufficient feedstock and efficient processes.  

Now consider a slough of tidal water moving at 4 knots.  It might be 2 m deep and 10 meters wide.  So the speed is 2 m/s, and that cubed is 8 divided by 2 is 4 times 20 square meters times 1000 kg is 20 kW or so.  Of course this is total available, not what you can get out easily, but with an array going down into a number of parallel sloughs in a wetland area it should be possible to do this while remaining concealed.  

I need a combination of rules of thumb with videos showing demonstrated power values in functioning motors, with power *measured* in multiple ways.

Among these experiments is using mechanically generated electrical power to split water into H2 and O2, heating water with a I^2R heater, heating air with same, running a pump to pump water uphill, which can then be drained back down to get the energy back, and building up charge in a giant capacitor.

Also, part of this must be electrochemical energy storage which uses aluminum cans.  These cans are so common that it makes sense to use them.  We want HUGE capacitance and HUGE voltage, and fast charging so some kind of giant electrolytic capacitor where the cans are treated to get the right surface properties is in order.  

This is where the SlimeZistor is relevant. I need universal SlimeZistor and Fractal Reactor technology in order to make a *network* of electrochemical cells, with pumps and valves and various electrodes along the way.  We will all live in the water, in creeks and ponds and swamps and streams and rivers and deltas and sloughs and bays and garbage reefs. 



## LiPo Batteries

This requires detailed survey of how to scavenge them, safety, how to charge, lifetime, how to dispose
