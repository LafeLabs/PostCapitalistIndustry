# Energy

- mass equivalent
- heat
- radiation
- force and distance, work
- steam
- oil and the petrocarbon energy cycle and system

\$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}]\$

ipython notebooks:

1. lots of units
2. E = mc^2
3. oil and coal calculations
4. steam calculations
5. heat calculations with human body, sleeping bag, room, house, various heat losses, use of numbers from insulation at Home Depot

radiation thermometry with trash wizard stick, use the phone to measure radiation temperature of things IR camera 


## Radiation and the sun, hot bodies

## Heat and the Earth

## Energy in the Age of Steam

GO dig into the steam books, taking reference notes, putting together a well researched story, make crude steam engine from trash, do some simple thermo expeeriments 

## Oil and the Petrochemical Energy Cycle

Go read books on this, start to put togehter the global vitalstatistics

## cooling, "coolth", air conditioning, refrigeration, entropy

build:

1. solar heat engines
2. solar thermal regulation of hot tool to work thermo plastics
3. solar steam turbine that drives magnet in coil that makes stored electricity
4. thermal physics demonstrations with hot water and joule heat
5. lots of energy harvesting with wheels: wind, water, different sizes and flow rates
6. high voltage storage systems from direct energy of various kinds
7. vacuum pump based water cooling, measurement, build pumps, measure vacuum 


## Concept of Ambient Energy gets whole Section(of this chapter)

draw the road map from very practical energy harvestors for my robots now to much more grand visions including robots that can go by themselves for hundreds of years, forraging for trash and processing it.
