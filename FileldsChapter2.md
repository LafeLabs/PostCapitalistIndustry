# Force and mass

Density field most tangible, the only field here with mass

# Electric Field, Voltage

E field from a charged ball, B field from a dipole, the concept of dipole, the mystery of the monopole

# Electric Current and Charge

More applications of electric field, 

# Magnetic field 

vector potential may be useful for our graphical approac, go back through the whole vector potential thing for magnetic dipoles

# Pressure and velocity of fluids

# Temperature
