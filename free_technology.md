# What is Free Technology?


Anarchist technology is always free.  It is owned by no one.  Not only is there no intellectual property, there is no physical property, except for the Trash Wizard stick, which might effectively be a part of a Trash Wizards person.  The act of creation of an anarchist artifact is a gift to society of that artifact.  A trash wizard might grab any technology lying around and re purpose it at any time.  Anarchist technology does not recognize the concept of assigning value to things numerically in any way.  Anarchist technology may get involved in various value circles, having various types of abstract relationships with various value circles, as codified in the Data Feed.  Anarchist technology is also energy free in the sense that it always uses ambient energy, be it a set of pedals, a hand crank, a wind turbine, a steam turbine, a tidal generator, a lightning accumulator, or a solar concentrator.  Anarchist technology is designed to be as modular as possible, being as friendly with other unrelated technology as possible.  Anarchist technology does not distinguish between information, energy, and materials--all three are processed as equal participants in the various flow through the system.  Technology is not to be considered free unless it can be constructed by a small band of trash wizards using their trash wizard sticks using common source materials from the waste stream of the old extractionist economy.  The ideology of trash wizardry is that capitalist industry sacrificed itself for the bounty of our new free world.  Mining is dangerous and destructive and suicidal, but it's done, and we thank our ancestors, thank their sacrifice and their hard work and the creation of so much material wealth so evenly distributed(you can find a mineral from anywhere pretty much everywhere thanks to the spread of capitalist industrial technology).  We give thanks for this great gift from our ancestors and build a society based on free living on the bones of the old world. We accept that things will never go back to how they were before industrial capitalism but that we can live better because of our mineral inheritance.  We accept that the ways of the old world were a suicide pact, but also that even in a more free world, we can never be free from change and uncertainty.  Ways of life, empires, whole worlds, climates, continents, will rise and fall, and we cannot stop that level of cataclysmic change from happening.  But we can build an adaptable and sustainable future based on free values that moves forward into a future actually worth seeing.  We can bring adventure back into the human condition, as well as acceptance of a huge and uncertain world, and our role as passengers on it.   

Anarchist technology also breaks barriers between customer, worker, engineer.  We eliminate these hierarchical notions.  We are people. We build things as needed and help each other as needed.  We tell stories to express our values with the help of our Data Feed.  We break the very idea of an economy open and build a new way of relating to each other and existing.  

What does it mean for hardware to be free?

Free means that a thing can be created with only labor and the waste products of the old world or renewable products of the natural world, using information that is available to the public both physically and logistically.
 
•	If someone claims the legal right to control who can make a thing it is not free.

•	If materials mined or otherwise extracted from the Earth are needed to make a thing it is not free

•	If professional expertise that cannot be learned in a short time from clear online instructions are required to 
make a thing it is not free

•	If a tool from the consumer capitalist economy is required to make a thing(e.g. a 3d printer from a factory) it is not free

•	If the fabrication of a thing requires the use of energy from the Grid or non renewable sources, it is not free

•	If a thing cannot be re integrated into the industrial ecosystem in a modular way after its lifetime it is not 
free
 
I seek to build a motor that is free in the sense described here.  I think of free as that which is not unfree, where unfree is defined by a list like the above.  or:
 
•	A free thing can be made from readily available waste *streams* of the existing industrial capitalist system

•	A free thing is not patented and is disclosed publicly in sufficient detail to make patenting illegal

•	A free thing has publicly shared non copyrighted instructions which enable a non expert to learn what they need to 
learn to complete the construction of the thing

•	A free thing can be fabricated in a scalable way, from single units up through millions of units, with automation at large volume using robots built from same technology

•	A free thing uses only ambient energy to function

•	A free thing has a post life trajectory built into the design, where all components are easily salvaged into other 
Free Things

•	The construction of a free thing must create value from “nothing”, which can be a medium of economic exchange 
outside the world of central bank debt
 
It’s clear why I have to start with the motor here: without a free motor, it’s impossible to build anything else free because it would require automation using motors from the old system.  With a *class* of motor that can be built to many specifications, a whole electromechanical technology can be built from the ground up that is all free in this sense.

What is the connection between free hardware and open source hardware? Open source hardware does not at all have to be free: it can require a vastly expensive factory to actually produce, as long as the design is publicly available.  This maintains the power relationships of industrial capitalism: the means of production remain safely in the hands of the capitalists, we are just re-aranging how we share amongst ourselves.  The difference between free and open can be more subtle for software where it’s always free in the sense that it can be copied an infinite number of times for no cost in principle.  Hardware on the other hand is not just information.  Without supply chains that are wrested from the control of the masters of the system, what is or is not free is affected very little by “open source” hardware.

Another important shortcoming in the open source model is the lack of demand for the project to be accessible to those outside the technical guild that built it.  This is not as bad as it used to be, but it’s still common practice for “open” to mean a thing has horrible documentation and usability as contrasted to “closed” commercial software.  What this really does is *further* enforce the class divisions in capitalist society by making a hierarchy of who gets free stuff and who doesn’t.  Those who are in the software tech guild can get free things that are unusable to a normal person, and which have such opaque help  that no one outside the guild can be reasonably expected to figure it out.

Avoiding this shortcoming of open source software in the free hardware project will be particularly tricky.  This means that if you want to use a permanent magnet and coils of current carrying wire for a thing, the quality of applied physics education you make available to your user determines the freeness or non freeness of your technology.  That means that any free electromechanical technology is not really deployed until a whole curriculum is made freely available on classical mechanics and electrodynamics.  That curriculum must be held to much higher standards than are presently applied for college or high school physics education.  It must be very applied, with direct numerical examples throughout which can be used live using python notebooks.  Also it must be able to cater to a very diverse range of learning styles: hands on, mathematical, theoretical, visual, etc etc.  *All* of these must be made freely available in multiple open free formats.  It must be possible to do this with printed pages and no computer or with any type of computer or personal device and no printer(either).  When the thing is built, it must have information printed on it or embedded in some obvious way, which links back to the main free storehouse of documentation.  That documentation must also be decentralized to prevent any authority from destroying the information.

This imperative really affects the way that progress moves along.  A working wire coil is not enough.  It must be well characterized and documented with a series of easily accessible physics experiments.  There must be youtube and instructables content showing how to put it together.  These experiments lead to a very fractal level of digression, but in the end they lead to absurdly robust technology which can be recreated from scratch by anyone anywhere quickly.

I’m pretty sure the next physics thing I need to get working on the motor that’s not for motor function is the LRC demo.  I want to see a damped LC oscillator, measure Q and resonant frequency for a few C values to determine L, then see how L is affected by various high permeability objects placed in or around the coil.

Then I probably want to make a nicer coil winder with a hand crank, buy one more round of 24 AWG copper wire, and wind a bunch more coils, then back to real motor design with the stick frame.

What is free energy?  Usually this term is used by various conspiracy nuts to describe ways of "getting energy for free" from something like the zero point quantum energy or the Earth's magnetic field.  Both of these are nonsense, as are all the free energy schemes presented throughout youtube and the rest of the Internet.  

No, we are told, energy is not "free".  It has to COME from somewhere.  But this notion is based on a capitalist world view.  Energy is deemed "free" if you don't have to get it from a mine and labor.  Renewable energy is not free: much labor is expended to build the infrastructure out of mined minerals which have a finite lifetime and eventually go to landfill to be replaced by more mining and labor.  

But if free energy is energy that can be useful but is not derived from mining and labor, then free energy can and does exist.  Energy not spent on air conditioning when you build under a shade tree is free energy.  Energy from the sun that warms through your front window is free energy.  And the electrical energy stored in salvaged rebuildable capacitors from salvaged rebuildable robots storing ambient energy is free. 

Capitalist logic always looks for ways to show that things are not really free, because capitalism is based on the ideas that value comes from labor and mined minerals.  If we approach industrial development from an anarchist perspective, however, we seek to build technology which is truly free, where no mineral extraction is implied in its construction.  

A technology is free when it gives more than it takes.  For instance a robot might require a few hours of service from human labor once a year.  But if it does the equivalent of even just a few hundred hours of human labor it has a net negative cost in labor-value.  In terms of minerals if it is built from minerals that were polluting the world around us, the mineral cost is negative: as opposed to subtracting value from the land as mining does it adds value to the land.  And finally the energy of the technology must be free in the sense that it absorbs from something unwanted elsewhere.  

Ultimately what is being built here is a form of artificial life.  Life takes only what can be given from somewhere else.  Our technology exists in a world where humanity is God.  This all goes back to the notion that the structure of our technology is based on the monotheism of its initial architects.  We have built a technological world where Man is God and only God is above Man(to use biblical sounding gibberish).  

But this technology will be alive, will exist as animals and plants do, without a God.  This means that while it needs humanity to help it survive at all stages and can easily be controlled by humanity it will exist on its own and can funtion to a large extent on its own, following it's hardware-progammed logic to find what it needs in the environment to keep living and carrying out its mission.
