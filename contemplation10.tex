\subsection{Tenth Contemplation: Torus, the four
circles}\label{tenth-contemplation-torus-the-four-circles}

The torus has 4 types of circle which are fundamentally different from
each other. There are the small circles of cross sections that go
through the axis of symmetry and the larger circles that go through the
plane perpendicular to that axis. But there are also two classes of
diagonal circles that encircle both holes of the torus! Contemplate this
and color the torus in, then go find a place where production could
practically occur and contemplate the torus further, with the extra
circles representing the idea of extra forms of order and production
hidden from view and wrapped in with the obvious existing ones.
