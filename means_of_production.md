### Bring the Means of Production to the Action


Most communists and anarchists direct us to turn the factory into a place of political action.  I propose to do the opposite: to bring the means of production to the action.  Where there are protests or occupations or refugee camps or war or poverty, Trash Magic can shine a light in the darkness.

### Production in Autonamous zones

practical considerations, examples, actually go do it and record it and put it on youtube

### fucking shit up through "selling" stuff

build artistic pieces that do useful stuff out of trash, sell for a few hundred dollars each at underground popup stores, keep none of the money, all cash only, distribute it physically as cash in most disruptive possible way to undermine money system.  

Build and use cash "gun"
