### Bring the Means of Production to the Action


Most communists and anarchists direct us to turn the factory into a place of political action.  I propose to do the opposite: to bring the means of production to the action.  Where there are protests or occupations or refugee camps or war or poverty, Trash Magic can shine a light in the darkness.

### Production in Autonamous zones

practical considerations, examples, actually go do it and record it and put it on youtube

### fucking shit up through "selling" stuff

build artistic pieces that do useful stuff out of trash, sell for a few hundred dollars each at underground popup stores, keep none of the money, all cash only, distribute it physically as cash in most disruptive possible way to undermine money system.  

Build and use cash "gun"

One of our goals is to erase arbitrary lines between things that are currently separated.  Just as some people have tried to erase lines between protest, occupation and party. I want to erase lines between industry and art, between protests and factories and workshops and squats.  Anywhere there are people and materials there can be industry. 

It's worth mentioning that I don't mean just crafts or hobbies or art in the current definitions.  Part of what separates industry from those activities today is how they all scale.  Art gets its value partly from a deliberate non-scalability.  Crafts are almost deliberately set up to be non scalable as well, to create some kind of perverse joy in doing things slowly and with a lot of specialized skills.  One speaks of a "craftsperson" as someone who has mastered some difficult special skill, and who therefore has special privileges associated with that skill.  

In Marx's day there was such a thing as an industrial worker, and maybe in some places there still is.  The industrial worker is part of a larger whole which uses economies of scale to change how people, energy and materials move in such a way that it will always beat out other forms of production on efficiently and "price".  This has led to a historical dead end as the capitalists have carved up the global working class so effectively.  And good riddance!  Do we really all want to work in some giant factory doing identical boring tasks for many hours, even if the IWW "owns" the factory and we all have free food and health care? Fuck that future. We bring the factory to the streets where the party is, inject art and culture in it, and make it able to thrive and grow fast in the current world. 

Here's how it happens.  Anywhere there are people, energy and materials, we just start building industrially and creating art as part of that process. We build processes and document them(this used to be called culture) which can be spread  and expanded quickly, which allow any group of people with minimal skills to rapidly build an effectively infinite inventory of useful industrial products such as air conditioners, water purifiers, massagers, grinding tools, communications infrastructure, blenders, coffee machines, electric wheelchairs, soaring surveillance drones, and medicine.  All these goods are immediately entered into the global decentralized database of free artifacts, which allows them to be immediately taken by courier by hand to users who absorb it instantly into society.  

This totally changes the balance of power in any occupation.  If instead of occupying the center of town and putting ourselves in conflict with current society we imagine a bunch of yuppies having to go down into a Sacrifice Zone to get some awesome artifact they can't get anywhere else, which they also can't pay fed debt for. There is no transfer of fed debt or "ownership", so all the normal regulations that apply to commerce do not apply.  We slip between the cracks to build up the factory, make stuff, absorb trash, improve the environment by putting in infrastructure easter eggs, and disappear.  Often the people who come together to do this will simply not exist as a coherent organization before or after the industrial/art event.  

The powers that be know how to protect "property" and to keep the have nots from getting it from the haves.  Much of this has to do with regulating money.  What they do not have experience with is free people giving away free stuff from trash and ambient energy in on and around their system.  They're prepared for a broken shop window, but not a free beer fountain in the park.  They're prepared for a black bloc in the middle of the town square but not a boat factory in the middle of a polluted-to-death river.  They are prepared for half a dozen commercial surveillance drone sent to spy on the cops.  They are not prepared for 10,000 soaring drones built from trash, soaring over the dead land of the American West looking for pollution and mapping it for future use by our industry.  

And this process is within reach now!!!  I still think the first industrial process is the coil winding process which is used to make more of itself.  This means both a coil winding machine and the power tools needed to quickly break down electrical appliances to get the copper wire out and the infrastructure required to track down rare earth magnets, as well as power tools to make lots of Skeletron and plastic parts quickly.  So this means drills and grinders and saws and also heat tools for working plastic, grinding tools for taking stuff apart, and good sensors for tracking down magnets.  Also free decentralized access to all the needed data. Energy must be ambient, not oil or human. 

This set of tactics then informs the overall strategy and vice versa.  It tells you where to occupy and for how long and with whom, at least to some extent.  We need ambient energy. That means the sun, the wind, and moving water.  Moving water is usually going to be the best choice because the energy density can be so high.  With 1000 times the density of air, a relatively slow river can be much better than even pretty fast wind.  And way more pleasant to work around.  Also waves and tides can be used, as well as in some cases water that has been pumped uphill over a long time before the establishment of a industrial occupation.  

We reflect the industrial occupation of today through the looking glass: rather than not building stuff in a factory we build stuff in a not-factory.  

So the first choice for a site is on flowing water, with tides and waves especially helpful.  Also note that natural water, even very polluted water, is also a source of many useful industrial feedstock.  At minimum you have H2 and O2, but usually a vast wealth of other chemicals.  So a very polluted wetland in the mouth of a river is an ideal site.  With a combination of skeletron and plastic we can build an amphibious set of shelters and transports and food and water production which add up to self sufficiency.  

Then we need materials, raw materials with a clear path to an industrially produced artifact or set of artifacts and raw materials to be moved by courier to another post capitalist industry node.  

metal and plastic.  And wood.  And stones.  This can be many places.  Rivers with trash in them, with littoral robots that go out and find it is easy pickings.  Also any dump of car or electronics related junk by a river or lake or sea.  And there are so many of these! Sacrifice Zones are often near water.  And usually have unlimited trash available.  

We roll in, we build and distribute, set up infrastructure easter eggs, and move on.  While where there, we create a one-off unique culture for that time and place, which propagates through the physical artifacts which carry data that includes the artistic culture of that unique time and place.  This also means that the phenomenon that replaces the current protest model can be more long lasting.  Imagine if any of the famous protests or occupations, such as for instance the AIM occupation of Alcatraz had been run this way.  You could, today, use an artifact with a piece of iron from a rebar salvaged from Alcatraz and painted by one of the occupiers there.  Such an artifact could then have been used for an electromagnet in a big motor that ground coffee beans in Zuccotti park during Occupy Wall Street, which was then incorporated into a sort of Jawa art car that roams the toxic waste deserts of Arizona, collecting minerals for another future project, all with added stories and media and art.  

How different this would be! We could all be participating in various insurrections, art communes, famous science experiments, and huge parties at the same time, endlessly remixing artifacts that carry all that culture with them.  

I need to find the Sacrifice Zones that exist in the coastal waters of the East coast.
