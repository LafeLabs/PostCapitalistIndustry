## Tenth Contemplation: Torus, the four circles

The torus has 4 types of circle which are fundamentally different from each other.  There are the small circles of cross sections that go through the axis of symmetry and the larger circles that go through the plane perpendicular to that axis.  But there are also two classes of diagonal circles that encircle both holes of the torus!  Contemplate this and color the torus in, then go find a place where production could practically occur and contemplate the torus further, with the extra circles representing the idea of extra forms of order and production hidden from view and wrapped in with the obvious existing ones.
