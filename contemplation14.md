## Fourteenth Contemplation: Ion from Earth

In my extended version of the alchemy based world view, the cube represents the element Earth and the sphere represents the element Ion.  For this, go out in the world with your coloring book, find a piece of fantastic source material for the new world such as a rock, stick, bottle, or dog turd.  Stare at the thing, color in the ion emerging from the earth and contemplate the emergence of new elementals from the old as a new type of alchemy is born.
