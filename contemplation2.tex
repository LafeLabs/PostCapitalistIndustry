\subsection{Second Contemplation: Tetrahedral
Fractal}\label{second-contemplation-tetrahedral-fractal}

Here fabrication is part of the practice, we carve out a very simple
tetrahedral depression in a stick, chop up bottle caps and apply heat to
them to smash them into the mold, making a plastic tetrahedron. This
process is repeated several times, and then the individual units are
built up into a larger structure by welding the corners. This
contemplation involves staring at the very limited porto-fractal shape
and contemplating how it would scale up and down, and the limits of that
process. How big could you make this? Or how small? What is easy or
hard? Try it.

This is a very inward-looking contemplation, and it should involve some
fairly meditative(more than the previous one) floor flopping movements.

This is about anarchy-freedom. So anarchist songs are what this
Contemplation is themed to. I will start with the Yiddish song Down with
The Police.
