# Chapter 3: Core Principles

## Statement of Principles


* All technology should be free
* All people should be free to leave a technical sphere and enter or build another one
* All national borders are not legitimate and must be abolished
* The world is magical.  The properties we have always called "magic" can be ascribed to all things in the physical world, and these powers can be harnessed by the techniques of Trash Magic
* Capitalism cannot and should not be reformed, it should be opposed in all places and times until it dies
* The concept of professionalism is harmful to the human condition, it poisons the soul, and is evil 		
* The concept of finite number to represent human values is a mind virus must be purged.  The infinite exposes deeper truths than finite.  These problems go to the deepest level of our mathematical thought from arithmetic to the underlying axioms of mathematics
* Morality consists of a set of axioms.  An axiom is a unproven statement which we take to be true in order to build up a system of thought which can guide action.  The principles in this list are put forth as axioms.
* It is not our role to debate capitalism with its defenders.  Every possible basic argument for or against capitalism already exists on the Internet.  Our job is to build a set of moral axioms, a set of technical skills and knowledge and build up a practical society from that.  It is not our job to waste time repeating the same arguments with capitalist apologists and time wasters. 
* No technology should be made from mass-mined materials
* The sum total of all money that exists in the world is a small fraction of what would be needed to compensate the victims of capitalism from its crimes(e.g. slavery and imperialism), thus there can be no justice within that system
* Every single word said every single idea ever put forth by an economist is a vicious lie. Economics is not a science, and this work is rejecting traditional science anyway.  It is not our job to argue with the economist it is our job to build a better world in which they are not welcome.
* The wage system must be abolished
* End work.  I am against work in all forms.  We must attack the concept of work at all levels.
* Technology is personal, as it should be. Relationships between technology and the human body are always in mind.




## Design Rules

Engineers who build technology usually use something called "design rules" and "figures of merit" as guides for how to build a thing.  The following are the different design rules in which we may deviate from capitalism to end up with technically different results:

1. The more general solution is always better
2. The Most readily available materials are always the first choice to use as well as to study
3. The most obvious solution is the best, although what is obvious may not be obvious
4. Self similarity is a desirable property, and by default it will be built in for several(but not infinite!) zoom factors to all technical systems
5. All technology is art, all art is technology
6. All technology contains its own data, is linked to itself on the web, self documents how to make more, where it came from, where it is going
7. Technology is not really deployed until you can create it with zero federal reserve debt or consumption of mined or extracted material.  To deploy a technology is simply to make it and have it get used, and you must spend zero money to make that happen.  Selling it after that is optional, and can be done for workers to get central bank debt currency but can also not be, and all parts can float in and out of different value circles(more on this later in this work)
8. Absolute precision will scale linearly with scale, meaning that we might keep just 10% relative precision at different scales, with gross motion at 1 meter with a few cm uncertainty, then a few cm motion with a few mm precision, on down to 1 nm motion with 1 angstrom precision.  
9. Every piece of technology should be as versatile as possible, with clear and easy instructions encoded in it for many uses
10. We will not build or work with those who build antipersonnel weapons. Drones and other machines are fair game as targets, however 
11. Every technological component should have the maximum possible number of uses, and should be cross referenced with other instances of itself so that the user can find out those other uses instantly, and this should be true of all the sub-components of a technical artifact
12. Every technological artifact and component should tell a personal story, connected to users, builders, and artists.
