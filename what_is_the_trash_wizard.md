What is a Trash Witch?  What is a Trash Wizard?  

Witches and Wizards have for centuries been symbols of humans' ability to wield various magic powers.  I draw on many traditions for this concept, from pagan lore through Tolkien and Harry Potter.  The traditions built up from fiction, culture, and religions of various kinds give us a picture to draw on for the archetype of the Trash Magician.  I don't want to use the term "magician" too much though because it can be mistaken for the person who puts on a magic show.  Perhaps that is not all bad, though!  The magic show can both teach and inspire wonder and that is certainly one goal of Trash Magic.  

A potential downside of calling us all witches and wizards is that those can be gendered terms, and that's not what I'm looking for with this new society.  But I will propose for the sake of this work a non gendered definition of witch and wizard.  The person wielding trash magic at any time is practicing witchery or wizardry if they are doing witch like magic or wizard like magic.  

What?

Well, for example, let's say you're in the woods at night, doing some hard core potion making and saying something like "fair is foul and foul is fair", and there's a lot of cackling.  That's witchery.  If you're in a huge field of rocks swinging your Trash Staff around and launching lighting bolts at the other rocks, that's wizardry.  It doesn't matter what gender the practitioner may or may not have--if you are wizarding you're a wizard, if you're witching you're a witch.  At least for the moment.  Mostly trash magicians have both Trash Wizard and Trash Witch natures, and most magics we practice  will use both as well.  

But I have still only loosely defined this way of being.  The Trash witch is someone who believes in a world where we both have a element of adventure and mystery in our lives and where we have the advantages of what we now call "modern technology".  We believe that this magic should be available freely to everyone in the world, and that everyone in the world should have the freedom to wield this and modify it as they see fit, and use or not use whatever magic they need or don't need.  

Trash Wizards and Trash Witches use the laws of physics and the methods of applied physics as a form of magic.  We teach that magic to others, and spread both the serious scholarship of Trash Magic and the basic practical skills needed to give the magic to all.  

All our teaching and building is free.  Free, meaning outside the money system and capitalist economy.  But also free meaning people have total freedom to take this and duplicate it and modify it and make it truly their own.  A love of pure science demos is a core value of the Trash Wizard or Witch.
