## Why Trash?

Who owns a dog turd left on the street?  Who owns the piles of plastic bottles that collect in an eddy of an urban stream?  Who owns the soot that collects on the walls of a bus stop?  No one.  The concept of private property, which I regard as evil, does not incorporate all things. For capitalism to function it has to have both "assets" and "liabilities", which the capitalists associate with opposite signs of numbers.  What if a turd is not a liability or an asset?  It does not exist in the capitalist universe, it is their ultimate trash, of value to no one, and it is the seed that we must use to create a better world.  

## Why Magic?

Many reasons.  First of all, what exactly is magic?  It's subjective.  Magic is what, subjectively, gives us a certain feeling of wonder about the world.  I believe that that wonder should be intrinsic to our technology always, just as we expect it to be with art.  Hence the removal of the artificial separation between art and technology is a path to what is essentially a form of magic.  

Also, the use of this word is very annoying to members of the technocratic priesthood which this work seeks to undermine. The very possibility that someone might do something useful and interesting in a sphere called magical is upsetting to them, because it is clearly not part of their "pure", "rational" world.  This thus draws a line in the sand of sorts: on one side is engineering and business and the rest of the "rational world", and our work stands very much on the other side, where things are a little less sharp and clear and countable.  Hence my statements in the first chapter about Trash Magic being an artistic movement in this first stage.



## What is a Trash Witch?  What is a Trash Wizard?  

Witches and Wizards have for centuries been symbols of humans' ability to wield various magic powers.  I draw on many traditions for this concept, from pagan lore through Tolkien and Harry Potter.  The traditions built up from fiction, culture, and religions of various kinds give us a picture to draw on for the archetype of the Trash Magician.  I don't want to use the term "magician" too much though because it can be mistaken for the person who puts on a magic show.  Perhaps that is not all bad, though!  The magic show can both teach and inspire wonder and that is certainly one goal of Trash Magic.  

A potential downside of calling us all witches and wizards is that those can be gendered terms, and that's not what I'm looking for with this new society.  But I will propose for the sake of this work a non gendered definition of witch and wizard.  The person wielding trash magic at any time is practicing witchery or wizardry if they are doing witch like magic or wizard like magic.  

What?

Well, for example, let's say you're in the woods at night, doing some hard core potion making and saying something like "fair is foul and foul is fair", and there's a lot of cackling.  That's witchery.  If you're in a huge field of rocks swinging your Trash Staff around and launching lighting bolts at the other rocks, that's wizardry.  It doesn't matter what gender the practitioner may or may not have--if you are wizarding you're a wizard, if you're witching you're a witch.  At least for the moment.  Mostly trash magicians have both Trash Wizard and Trash Witch natures, and most magics we practice  will use both as well.  

But I have still only loosely defined this way of being.  The Trash Witch is someone who believes in a world where we both have a element of adventure and mystery in our lives and where we have the advantages of what we now call "modern technology".  We believe that this magic should be available freely to everyone in the world, and that everyone in the world should have the freedom to wield this and modify it as they see fit, and use or not use whatever magic they need or don't need.  

Trash Wizards and Trash Witches use the laws of physics and the methods of applied physics as a form of magic.  We teach that magic to others, and spread both the serious scholarship of Trash Magic and the basic practical skills needed to give the magic to all.  

All our teaching and building is free.  Free, meaning outside the money system and capitalist economy.  But also free meaning people have total freedom to take this and duplicate it and modify it and make it truly their own.  A love of pure science demos is a core value of the Trash Wizard or Witch.  

Another goal is independence.  A group of just Trash Witches should for example be able to live on their own, with a good quality of life.  Maybe dozens of Wizards or dozens of Witches can easily form tribes to build and scavenge and do adventures and art.  But also tribes can form super-tribes which merge to build truly large works.  The only way giant social structures can be optional and not control us all is for us to be able to live freely with just a few people.  The magic we plan to wield here is designed to give people that power.

We also strive to amuse.  You don't want to learn about magnetic fields just because they're useful.  You can see from us that they're actually magical!  Magical enough that a show put on with magnetic fields or electric fields is very much worth watching.  In fact, one of the most popular shows in most science museums is the electric field demonstrations with giant lighting machines.  

So a Trash Magician uses a combination of Wizardry and Witchery to amuse and provide for people with Trash of the world. Trash is generally stuff that is not only free but infinitely free.  Not only can you go find one or two or 10,000 of a thing, you know that later you can go back and do that again as many times as you want.  This is true with flowing water from spring snow runoff or from tides or drainage of some large rainy area. It's true of winds that always blow, of the sun, of sand and dirt and rocks.  It's true of sticks shed by the lower sections of pine trees.  And it's true of the plastic bottles thrown away by capitalist society.  

A society of free stuff is not one with "zero cost".  It's one where cost is infinite but value is also infinite.  We are moving to a value system that works mostly with infinities.  That is part of what makes Trash Magic actually magical.  And if you're a Trash Witch or Wizard, that's your stuff!  You wield the magic that moves the trash around!  

In addition to Trash Wizardry and Witchery one might be a Trash Daemon or Trash Imp.  Trash Goblins can have a place in our community but not Trolls.   

Trash Wizards are always there for everyone.  We welcome the refugees of capitalism and it's evil twin, war.  We do not recognize the validity of borders and are here to help subvert them as needed to help the down trodden.  

## Alchemy, Chemistry and Art

Part of the narrative we learn when we study chemistry in school is that of the failure of alchemy to accurately describe the elements.  We learn that these primitive pre-chemists thought of the elements as being earth, air, fire and water, rather than the array of chemical elements we know in today's periodic table.  The *real* elements are divided up based on our supposedly superior modern understanding that atoms are the basis of all matter. 

I dispute none of basic science we all learned in school in terms of atomic structure, this manifesto is not quite that kooky.  What I do dispute is how information is organized in our minds and in our education system.  Consider an element like oxygen.  We know that a lot of oxygen in the world around us is in the form of two atoms together, as a gas which makes up about one fifth of the air around us.  We also know that all water has one oxygen atom(along with two hydrogens), and so all the water in our world has oxygen.  Fire is pretty much always a rapid chemical reaction involving oxygen, so we also know that all the flames we see in our world on Earth are partly made from a form of oxygen.  Finally, the one of the most common minerals on our planet is the relatively inert silicon dioxide that makes up most sand as well as many other minerals.  The melting point of this solid is well over one thousand degrees.  

Now, while I would never deny that it's useful to say all these things have oxygen, or to understand what that means, is that really the most pertinent quality they all have?   To the alchemist sand is "earth", fire is fire, water is water, and air is air.  Four elements, which we deal with very differently in all possible ways.  We look at that and say it's "wrong" because the knowledge of what atoms make up these things is somehow more "fundamental" supposedly.  But what if we didn't organize things that way, even though we understand how atoms work?  What if we still recognized that earth, air, water, and fire as elements, which just happen to be also made up of atoms?  This world view would have the same facts as the one we hold today, just with their order re-arranged.  

Ideally what I seek from this project is to remove these kinds of hierarchies altogether.    I don't want to say that alchemy is "right" and chemistry is "wrong", what I object to is the basic notion of right and wrong here.  It's based on the notion of our ideas having some kind of objective other reality beyond that of the world we live in.  I think this kind of ordering of ideas is one of the ways we've held ourselves back in science due to ideology.  

We need to stop banishing things like spells and elementals and potions from "real" science just because of cultural values.  A drug is a magic potion, what else would it be?  Prove it isn't!  A program on the firmware of a robot is a magic spell.  Prove it isn't!  And every artist knows art is magic.  The only way we have denied that in science is by simply saying we're better than art on the ladder of "reality".  This has, again, held us all back.  It's led to a century of inaccessible art and incomprehensible science.  We need to reunite the strands of alchemy, magic, art, and science.

## Symbology

Where to trash magic artists get our symbols?  From the natural world, from geometry, from anarchist iconography, and from religious art.  We also seek to replicate, but softened by the influence of the natural world, the design aesthetics of 20th century industry.  This will be almost a parody or a three dimensional rhyme of sorts, not so much to bring out the function of the industrial thing but to remind us of its form to make us think of where our trash comes from and what we are replacing.  

Note that when I say religious art, this is very broad, since much of art through the ages has always been inspired by whatever the artist viewed religion to mean.  Religion is our deepest held beliefs which form our world view outside of that which can be proven.  Art at its best tries to express what that means, and is often deeply religious, but takes very different forms due to the diversity of religious beliefs.  In particular, however, trash magic will lean toward the "occult" from various Western traditions.  Due to the author's non-indigenous Western background, I want to avoid appropriating cultural traditions of which I'm not a part.  And I feel like one way to do this is to focus on "pagan" traditions of various kinds, as well as occult Jewish and Christian art.  

The anarchist symbology will include the black wild cat used by the IWW and other anarchists, as well as various permutations of the circle A.  The following image combines the black cat with the form of the magnetic field from a tiny magnet, symbolizing one of the forces which we will harness in Trash Magic.

![Squat Sign](images/squat.png) 


Some electrical symbols will also be incorporated, partly since many things we will make involve building electrical circuits, and building those symbols into the art makes things self-documenting.  While these form a useful function in helping to make a thing free by documenting how it's put together, they should never abandon form for function: circuit documentation should be a work of art as much as a document.  

## Capitalisms Unwanted: a Human Treasure

One of the sources of constant pain for most people subject to global capitalism is the phenomenon of some humans being simply unwanted by capitalism.  The people who live in the big cities and write computer code for a living and control the nodes of power in our society no longer have use for most of humanity.  This is true even in a supposedly "rich" country like the United States or France.  Looked at globally, whole nations are written off by the global elite as disposable, a mere nuisance. Meanwhile, war, an inevitable aspect of capitalism, creates an endless stream of people who have had even what little shreds of social wealth they might have had smashed by the war machines of Capital.  Environmental destruction will also create increasing numbers of refugees as population grows and our living world continues to be murdered by Capitalists.  

The people in this "unwanted" demographic have nothing to gain from the current system.  Most of the laws in our system exist to protect property owners from those who do not have property.  As long as someone owns property, the capitalists care at least enough about them to tax them.  Once someone has no property *and* no special technical skills to put them in the priesthood of "tech" the capitalist system has zero use for them and thus doesn't bother to help them even survive any more than they have to as vestiges of the society the Reaganists have destroyed in the last 40 years.  

But from our standpoint the concept of a "lower class" simply makes no sense.  Each human mind has infinite power to create art and science and culture.  The fact that capitalism has created an infinite stream of unwanted humanity outside their system, who have zero vested interest in that system simply means there is an unlimited supply of human genius to deploy on post capitalist projects. The future belongs to those who are able to welcome capitalisms unwanted with open arms as the infinite treasure they are rather than constantly attempting to cull out the "unwanted" from their own ranks, driving the working poor out of their cities or off their land.  

We must develop technology/art/culture which naturally appeals to and is instantly useful to those abandoned by capitalism. It's the right thing to do, since they are the most underserved in the current system.  But it's also the long term strategic thing to do, since it means we will naturally out grow and overtake the capitalist system as we build something that is better enough that more and more strata of the existing society jump across to the free world and join us.     

## Skeletron: The Wooden Bones of ArtSkeletron is the system that makes the bones of Trash Magic artifacts.  Skeletron is simply a way to modify things found in your environment to make them play together well with Trash Magic.  Primarily this means gathering sticks, shaving them to be flat on one or more sides and removing the bark, and drilling holes in them.  Quarter inch holes spaced about one inch along the line of the sticks is the most basic component of Skeletron.  This can be used to do many things, and as more people build it and use it and modify it, it will become increasingly versatile and free.  
With a universal wood framing system we can build up many different human sized structures. This can be used to make various shelters, although to do this we will add plastics to the system, using methods of hand plastic welding detailed in the last chapter of this volume.  With the ability to make wood skeletons with plastic skins we can make waterproof structures on land as well as waterproof boat structures and amphibious artifacts of various kinds.  The combination of wood and plastic in a modular and modifiable way also can be the basis of all the other industrial constructions to be described in this work.  


## Trash Magic Kit: The Stickening

Part of practicing Trash Magic is having constant access to some basic technology kit, generally based on various sticks from the above system, which can be used to build up everything else.  


1. built in measuring stick in SI and English
2. build in measure tool for AWG of wires
3. LRC meter that reads out on phone
4. conversion to robot mode where it drives itself around
5. convenient single shoulder strap for comfortable wear like a bike messenger pack
6. random flash sticks which store MP3's of music ripped from youtube on the pi, controlled by the smart phone, and then replayed later
7. speaker built from our technology, reading flash drives out with the pi zero
8. pi zero
9. High voltage storage caps(detachable)
10. medium voltage storage caps(detachable)
11. super cap(detacheable)
12. LiPo Battery(detacheable)

14. screen for pi zero to read out a special dumb ass bat phone
15. measure nonlinear voltage response to impulse of various random blobs you find around
16. can harvest energy using a built in magnet and coil setup
17. water pump always available
18. trash wizard app for phone is set up for physics, interfaces with existing physics packages
19. audio high gain amp with speaker that can get high power sound to do feedback
20. goggles that can interface with various imaging technology using analog displays with vibrating fluids 
21. L R and C are all measured analog using the high gain audio stick
22. measure NOISE of all things, including Johnson and shot noise
 One of the many idiotic things capitalists say to shut up their critics is to point out that capitalism is the source of the smart phones that anti capitalists inevitably use.These devices are indeed amazing, and are no longer luxury items by any means. On the contrary, they are very much a survival tool used by the oppressed classes now, and it’s very dangerous to ignore that role this technology plays. But what aspect of them is so great? The social networking. That’s always what you need: access to the web, various messaging systems, and various commercial things like Uber and Lyft.
Does that really need to be a computer? A truly free phone would be a pure communication tool that communicates in a distributed way like fido net of old. the sole purpose of the hardware would be to communicate images, sounds, text, and to decide where those should go. That’s it. What the hell do you need a computer for? Mostly so that The Man can spy on you and figure out how to sell you shit you don’t need, and force you to constantly throw more federal reserve debt back into the machine for more advanced machines to get more indoctrination to continue the cycle.

Don’t be fooled by the dominance of the computer technology into believing that’s inevitable. It’s not. We can get orders of magnitude more benefit from peer to peer networks than we do today as slaves to the military industrial machine if these phones were all free like freedom, linked up on free hardware all the way. This can actually be the basic informational skeleton of the value circles.
 I believe that the hardware can be re worked from the ground up based on our approach to applied electromagnetism to get something with totally new fab. But in the mean time, given that that is a lengthy applied physics research project, what can we do? My answer is to watch closely everything that has anything to do with Raspberry Pi and other “internet of things” projects in the open hardware domain. I say “open hardware” here and not free hardware, because it’s not free according to my strict definition: it relies on mine- driven fab and capitalism, and there is IP in the supply chain(and some other problems). But it’s way better in terms of open and free than the whole android/apple ecosystem.
as seen here:https://www.adafruit.com/products/2885 (https://www.adafruit.com/products/2885)The pi zero sells for 5 dollars! And it’s free like freedom as far as the software goes, as I understand it. The problem of course is that it’s not what you’d call a product still. You need to buy a screen separately, and a battery, and some other odds and ends, and then put a package together, get all the software working, etc. It’s not trivial. Not insanely hard, but not trivial and also not really as usable as a apple or android.But surely this could change? If people want to work within the system of existing “tech” a fantastic place to focus efforts would be making this technology closer to truly free. This will be a combination of figuring out sourcing logistics on the hardware, making the software closer to what a phone user expects, and writing new software to make more free infrastructure that runs on the free hardware. If a truly free platform were to allow for the kind of peer to peer labor and goods sharing that for profit platforms now have, capitalism might just collapse overnight as people spontaneously are able to work and do things by communicating freely.
Don’t like the phone but like “tech”? make a free phone. It will happen one way or the other, but the more ways it happens the better for everyone.
