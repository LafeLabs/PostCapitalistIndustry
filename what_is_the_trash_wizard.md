What is a Trash Witch?  What is a Trash Wizard?  

Witches and Wizards have for centuries been symbols of humans' ability to wield various magic powers.  I draw on many traditions for this concept, from pagan lore through Tolkien and Harry Potter.  The traditions built up from fiction, culture, and religions of various kinds give us a picture to draw on for the archetype of the Trash Magician.  I don't want to use the term "magician" too much though because it can be mistaken for the person who puts on a magic show.  Perhaps that is not all bad, though!  The magic show can both teach and inspire wonder and that is certainly one goal of Trash Magic.  

A potential downside of calling us all witches and wizards is that those can be gendered terms, and that's not what I'm looking for with this new society.  But I will propose for the sake of this work a non gendered definition of witch and wizard.  The person wielding trash magic at any time is practicing witchery or wizardry if they are doing witch like magic or wizard like magic.  

What?

Well, for example, let's say you're in the woods at night, doing some hard core potion making and saying something like "fair is foul and foul is fair", and there's a lot of cackling.  That's witchery.  If you're in a huge field of rocks swinging your Trash Staff around and launching lighting bolts at the other rocks, that's wizardry.  It doesn't matter what gender the practitioner may or may not have--if you are wizarding you're a wizard, if you're witching you're a witch.  At least for the moment.  Mostly trash magicians have both Trash Wizard and Trash Witch natures, and most magics we practice  will use both as well.  

But I have still only loosely defined this way of being.  The Trash witch is someone who believes in a world where we both have a element of adventure and mystery in our lives and where we have the advantages of what we now call "modern technology".  We believe that this magic should be available freely to everyone in the world, and that everyone in the world should have the freedom to wield this and modify it as they see fit, and use or not use whatever magic they need or don't need.  

Trash Wizards and Trash Witches use the laws of physics and the methods of applied physics as a form of magic.  We teach that magic to others, and spread both the serious scholarship of Trash Magic and the basic practical skills needed to give the magic to all.  

All our teaching and building is free.  Free, meaning outside the money system and capitalist economy.  But also free meaning people have total freedom to take this and duplicate it and modify it and make it truly their own.  A love of pure science demos is a core value of the Trash Wizard or Witch.  

Another goal is independence.  A group of just Trash Witches should for example be able to live on their own, with a good quality of life.  Maybe dozens of Wizards or dozens of Witches can easily form tribes to build and scavenge and do adventures and art.  But also tribes can form super-tribes which merge to build truly large works.  The only way giant social structures can be optional and not control us all is for us to be able to live freely with just a few people.  The magic we plan to wield here is designed to give people that power.  

We also strive to amuse.  You don't want to learn about magnetic fields just for the hell of it or just because they're useful.  You can see from us that they're actually magical!  Magical enough that a show put on with magnetic fields or electric fields is very much worth watching.  In fact, one of the most popular shows in most science museums is the electric field demonstrations with giant lighting machines.  

So a Trash Magician uses a combination of Wizardry and Witchery to amuse and provide for people with Trash of the world. Trash is generally stuff that is not only free but infinitely free.  Not only can you go find one or two or 10,000 of a thing, you know that later you can go back and do that again as many times as you want.  This is true with flowing water from spring snow runoff or from tides or drainage of some large rainy area. It's true of winds that always blow, of the sun, of sand and dirt and rocks.  It's true of sticks shed by the lower sections of pine trees.  And it's true of the plastic bottles thrown away by capitalist society.  

A society of free stuff is not one with "zero cost".  It's one where cost is infinite but value is also infinite.  We are moving to a value system that works mostly with infinities.  That is part of what makes Trash Magic actually magical.  And if you're a Trash Witch or Wizard, that's your stuff!  You wield the magic that moves the trash around!  

In addition to Trash Wizardry and Witchery one might be a Trash Daemon or Trash Imp.  Trash Goblins can have a place in our community but not Trolls.
