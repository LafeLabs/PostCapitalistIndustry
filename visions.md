## Ent Moot

An Ent is a slow moving giant tree robot that can walk, it can take years for them to gather but they do gather, and along with their human care takers build stuff together then move on, very slowly.  An Ent Moot is the event where the Ents gather to communicate and build greater things as a group.   It can take decades ore centuries.  

The story here will thus take many lifetimes of humans but still have a narrative story.  Which brings me to the next part of this story: you need to tell it.  I'm not a fiction writer.  I'm writing these random sketches from vague images in my mind but one or more of you readers need to re write this into various fiction works, then combine them into this document.  This should become a flow of fiction through our world, where those who are into that sort of thing can create and collect it.  More tales! 


## Memoirs from a Bathtub

The Universe is in my bathtub.  All things and all people.  And today is bath day.  Well, yesterday was also bath day but today is *epic* bath day.  Today the bah goes out to the world.  I wake up in a roost under a bridge made from the usual Trash Magic infrastructure.  I do some basic hygiene stuff, then roll over the side into the tub waiting below, plop.  I reach up and work the controls on the roost to reset it for the next person, then lie back in the tub as the current starts to pull it into the main stream.  

The journey begins with setting a flag in the tub to summon a coffee drone, and just lying back to watch the morning clouds above. To set the mood for the day, I put White Rabbit on loop on the Trash rig, nice and loud.   Then I kick back and wait for it all to get rolling.  The coffee drone soon paddles along side my tub, and I grab a cup and bagel and focus on those for a bit while the main current drags the tub toward the Center.  

Go all over town, things get interesting!  I don't know how, though, you have to tell me, sorry.  

## Storm's a' Commin'

A storm is coming! So many joules of energy!  We will build everything, set things on fire, move heavy things around, describe the world of the sunken city built back up from the water out of trash wizard components.  There is a story here. Go.

## Witches Rolling in the Valley

Rolling robots going up and down the water, littoral robot ideas, using the creek for power and trash sources, clean up the river, make habitats etc. Many groups of wizards and or witches all around, going up and down the creek, making things happen, things appear from nothing and there is much rejoicing.  Go.



## Riding Against Thor: the Story of Warriors of the Storm Stealing Clean Water from the Gods of Thunder
 
Like the other storm story but more epic and a smaller group of more risk tolerant people, the warriors of the future, riding to glory by harnessing the storm

Living in the deep ocean, on the surface, in the storms, giant systems of mechanical oscillators that absorb the incoming energy of the storms and turns it into useful work, processing sea water and trash at the same time, storing energy, moving around, and making head, having a fucking party.  

Lazy river should be the main form of transportation in the future. Humans should live in the river deltas of the world, in clean water channels, in a civilization based on trash magic industry.  

Bathtubs, where we are all The Dude in his bath with his joint and his whale song music.  THAT is  the FUTURE.  

The inundated cities of the future can be a paradise, with storms making an ultimate comfort environment, light, sound, heat, air conditioning, breezes, smells, vibrations, motions, lazy rivers, free drugs, all made as the storms churn through, free energy free trash magic tools, free food, free space and time.  

Must build electric kayak ASAP.  

Really huge diamondoid matrix going for a mile on each side around the eye of a pacific storm, all made from trash, giant artificial mushrooms float around inside the matrix, hookah smoking caterpillars.  

## Poop Story

DOOM DOOM DOOM DOOM

I can hear the drum beat over the hill, it makes me want to poop.  Climbing the hill, as I come over the crest, I hear the guitars before I see them, with several epic metal interpretations of the infamous Brown Note.  As I come down the hill into the clearing, the drums start to shake the ground, lines of shirtless drummers across the earthen mound pounding for hours, a couple with joints hanging out of their mouths.

The guitarist is, as usual, suspended from a hydrogen aerostat floating above, strapped into a harness hanging from several cables that allow for full 3d motion, while shooting 10 meter flames from the flame thrower in the guitar in all directions.

Down on the far end I can see where the open pissers are peeing around in a stone and glass area that funnels the liquid into containers made from reclaimed glass beer bottles, converted to alchemal extraction tools, to get all the precious minerals and drugs out of the pee, as well as the pure water which is removed and used to make lemonade for the musicians above. But we segregate our bathrooms in a logical way, for good reason, I have SERIOUS business to attend to and head to the opposite end of the toiletsphere, where people with serious latrine business must all go.

I choose a particularly awesome looking stone throne, head into the chamber, close the door, and now have a well lit one person sealed stone room  all to myself.  I sit on the heated stone throne, kept at exactly 88 degrees F using temperature controlled oil flowing through holes carved into the living rock by various cyborgs built from genetically modified rock eating fungus and some constructor drones.  I now brandish my stick around in an easily recognizable way, alerting the local music machine to play sounds that correlate with the booms and shreds above, but with my own spin: stream and rain noises, with some German industrial noise music mixed in.

More brandishments of the stick call up a math paper I’ve been working on in the cloud on the shit paper unit, which I stare at for a while while nature takes its course.  Having dropped an epic deuce, I again brandish the trash magic stick, summoning the turd courier drone, which grabs the turd for further study and use.  I now clean myself up with the paper which was a math treatise a minute ago, throw it into the toilet, and have it get dragged off by another drone to the compost chamber where it will be turned into food for fungi which will be food for the hemp plants which will make the next generation of toilet paper for future users(watered by the water extracted from the urine).

Now I wash up in the sink, indicate to the chamber that the cleaning robots can flush the space clean and remake it for the next user, and move on through the exit door which leads to the opposite side of the berm that the toilet room is in. I stroll out the door, which closes behind me and locks, ready for the next user from the other side.  From there a short path leads down to the Science Swamp.  Here I see a bunch of nerds in goggles, some with surgically added gills, wallowing around in the muck, hair covered in duck weed.

“Hail E Coli! ”  I greet them as I give the proper gesture of rubbing the gut and hopping around.

“Hail E Coli!” they shout back.

I tell them I just came down from the Lemmy Pod up in the severe end of the shithouse, just now, and point to the one I came from.  Oh yeah, they say, we just saw yours roll in.  An image appears in phosphorescent swamp muck across the surface showing a turd being carried by a spider-like droid through a underground tunnel and dropping it into the fluid pool of an analysis pit with a plop.  I see the closest turdNerd who answered before reach out and grab a pair of stones hanging suspended under the water from some nearby steaks pounded into the swamp.  I can suddenly see the screen on the surface of the swamp come alive with the images that the coli witch sees in their goggles.  What do they see?  Both what the probe “sees” and what the infrared camera sees, as well as another screen that shows genetic information, with some strong artistic liberties taken by the local group here as usual.

“Oh yeah.  Good stuff, good stuff.”

“What?”  I ask

“I don’t know yet, but I see something in the genome here.   Something metal as fuck.  Something that should help with The Project, which we’ve been working on here.  And my sensors are picking up some sweet metal here in the  turd which should work for building nanoelectronics.  Here, since you used our toilet, I’d like you to take this, and make some more, does that sound cool?”

“ummmmmmmm…..”

“It’s cool.  It’s a methane and hydrogen dirigible drone designed to go spot trash for you. Pretty standard, but with more metal shit and turd iconography than usual.”

Well, fuck yeah metal is why i shit here.  “yeah, i’m in, hell yeah, i’ll spread the word, I can show some of those cliff diver people how to make this version when I head down there for the Big Storm.”

When they hear I’m heading down there, they get excited, and start laughing.  What, I ask?    What is your deal?

Well, they’ve used their methane fire tools to build yet another invention: a human cannon.  they offer to fire me in their cannon down to where the cliff divers chill, and I agree, and off I go, folded up Heavy Metal Shit Drone safely in my backpack.

When I reach the peak of the trajectory, I hail a skyhook from one of the aerostats with my magic stick, grab onto the cable, and start riding down over the trees toward the Cliffs.
