# Storm's a' commin'

# wizards rolling in the valley

rolling robots going up and down the water, littoral robot ideas, using the creek for power and trash sources, clean up the river, make habitats etc.

# Riding Against Thor: the story of warriors of the storm stealing clean water from the gods of Thunder
