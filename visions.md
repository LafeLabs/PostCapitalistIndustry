# Ent Moot

an ent is a slow moving giant tree robot that can walk, it can take years for them to gather but they do gather, and along with their human care takers build stuff together then move on, very slow

# Storm's a' commin'

A storm is coming! So many joules of energy!  We will build all the things, set things on fire, move heavy things around, describe the world of the sunken city built back up from the water out of trash wizard compontents

# wizards rolling in the valley

rolling robots going up and down the water, littoral robot ideas, using the creek for power and trash sources, clean up the river, make habitats etc. 

# Ramblin' youth

young trash wizards gather for a giant party in the jungle, build crazy shit


# Riding Against Thor: the story of warriors of the storm stealing clean water from the gods of Thunder

LIke the other storm story but more epic and a smaller group of more risk tolerant people, the warriors of the future, riding to glory by harnessing the storm


Living in the deep ocean, on the surface, in the storms, giant systems of mechanical oscillators that absorb the incoming energy of the storms and turns it into useful work, processing sea water and trash at the same time, storing energy, moving around, and making head, having a fucking party.  

Lazy river should be the main form of transportation in the future. Humans should live in the river deltas of the world, in clean water channels, in a civilization based on trash magic industry.  

Bathtubs, where we are all The Dude in his bath with his joint and his whale song music.  THAT is  the FUTURE.  

The inundated cities of the future can be a paradise, with storms making an ultimate comfort environment, light, sound, heat, air conditioning, breezes, smells, vibrations, motions, lazy rivers, free drugs, all made as the storms churn through, free energy free trash magic tools, free food, free space and time.  

Must build electric kayak ASAP.  

Really huge diamondoid matrix going for a mile on each side around the eye of a pacific storm, all made from trash, giant artificial mushrooms float around inside the matrix, hookah smoking caterpillars.
