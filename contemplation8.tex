\subsection{Eighth Contemplation: Shelf Fungus
Stairway}\label{eighth-contemplation-shelf-fungus-stairway}

Go out in Nature and find living things which are in harmony: fungus and
plant, plans and animal, bacteria and insect. Contemplate the living
things, sketch them onto the stairway of shelf fungi up a tree and color
it all in.
