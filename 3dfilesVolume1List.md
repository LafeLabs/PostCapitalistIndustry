14. built it: cube and sphere joined  with sphere sitting on cube, eye of the tiger


all these should be blender files, .stl files, wood or plastic or stone objects, 3d printed objects, any of those painted, and songs should be a youtube play list, they should all be displayed on a stick, and also in a location in second life.  They should be deployed in space and time.  


overall shape for 14 chapters is the truncated octahedron which has 14 sides, thus is a tetradecahedron

### Stories:

1. The pyramid represents the hierarchical nature of capitalism and the literal worship of stone monuments in that form as well as on the dollar bill.  Money and mining and misery.  We listen to City of Darkness during the Contemplation in order to remind us of the grim dark horror of industrial capitalism.
2. The fractal tetrahedron stack represents FREE technology, which can grow in any direction or scale up or scale down easily.  Making it from plastic trash molded in a carved stick makes it infinitely free in all ways.  FREEDOM! We listen to the Yiddish anarchist song about smashing the police because this like that a striving for freedom 
3. The scroll represents the guiding principles we use to build technology, just as the scroll represents laws in rule-of-law cultures.  FINAL COUNTDOWN.  This could be a boring set of rules but it should not be that it should be EPIC like this song, get pumped
4. The elements of alchemy are represented here, with the sphere for the added element of "ions".  Lights can be added to the base below the ball which can be translucent to create a glowing effect, represents the life giving power of the ion as an addition to the world view of alchemy.  During the Contemplation we listen to the Conan the Barbarian theme music in order to contemplate the Riddle of Steel from that story.
5. The key represents the locked-away knowledge in the University system now, which will be liberated by our universal key: insurrection. We listen to Black Aria by Danzig in order to simply set the mood of the university.  Danzig is awesome even though it's deeply inspired by not awesome Christian music, and that's ok.  We will build a place on campuses that is awesome in it's artistic mood even if it has some not good roots, and it will be GOTHIC because universities are pretty gothic.
6. the trash spider represents robots in general, nothing too complicated here! During the Contemplation we listen to Back in Black and imagine these robots riding out EVERYWHERE, and think about rumbles of robots rumbling around!
7. The fractal tube structure from welded plastic represents the fractal nature of what we build as well as the blurred line between art and technology. The Tron soundtrack has a fractal sound to it.  Imagine its fractal nature and stare at the fractal and imagine its scale and limitations etc. think of moving through the tubes like how the elements of Tron move thru the computer there
8. The shelf fungus in the form of plastic welded and shaped onto a vertical wooden stick represents our lore.  Shelf fungi are just the fruiting bodies of much larger organism systems that exist in the forrest.  They present themselves to the world to product spores that can spread their DNA through the forrest, growing the system.  This is what or lore does: spread our DNA for growth in the physical world.  STARE AT THE SHROOMS while listening to the White Rabbit, this is where you just think about the awesomeness of the lore and get moved by whatever lore you are working on now.
9. the moebius band made from car tire scraps represents the infinite nature of what we are creating as well as the concept of smashing cars and building new things from them that are unrelated--this is just art. Fun fun fun on the autobahn by Kraftwerk remind us that cars are *Everywhere* and their propaganda is as well, even in supposedly counter culture, we must get taken away by the horror of the cars and yet in a positive way by the infinity of the after car world
10. the torus represents the factory everywhere and nowhere.  A torus is a funny thing: many circles make up its body, and they can really trick you, I will show the *hidden* circles that go around at an angle and combine the two obvious classes of circle.  Ideally this should be a stone carved torus with paint to show the hidden circles
11. the trefoil pentagram represents our *techniques*.  It is made from simple wood sticks and represents how the pentagram, a symbol of magic, gets integrated in a practical physical thing and also in the mathematical abstraction of the trefoil knot
12. The cube with the carved depression for the sphere represents the next stage of development in which we actually build and distribute these things.  The depression should be the same as for the ion magic display, allowing the person who is doing the Contemplation to have their final action be to move the sphere from that display to this one.  That motion from alchemy theory to the simple cube of praxis represents the deployment of the ideas to the physical world. we listen to eye of the tiger after this while staring at it and contemplating the task ahead, run up the steps like rocky!




### The Contemplation

I wonder if the Contemplation should have motions as well? Perhaps flopping around on my head and stretching and waving sticks and rocks around in my room?  I think so.  Then I need a way to arrange the artifacts in 3d space over my floor/bed area so I can stare at them and also a youtube playlist that has all the songs so I can go thru the whole thing.  Fuck it, if I'm sick of BJJ and don't want to go back to judo and am not ready to start my own gym I'm just going to build my own system for working my body out, where I work only with trash magic elements in my camp area or room or whatever.  THE CONTEMPLATION.
