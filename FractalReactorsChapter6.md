Everything is made of thermo plastics.  Everything has pumps and valves driven by the usual Philosophy Engines.  Fuilds that can be pumped through any of the various tubes, allowing close to neutarlly bouyant robots to flow through to any location, and edit the tubes using heated tools.  So the whole thing can self-edit by moving robotic workers around with pumps.  

Biological systems can easily be integrated into the whole thing, grown, moved around, analyzed, combined, and used.  

Everything can be pumped with fluids, vacuum, air, other gasses, hot or cold fluids, biological slime, and various plasmas.  

HIgh voltages can drive electrostatic actuators anywhere and high currents can drive coils to drive magnets anywhere.  

Basic test systems can be made by cutting with heated tools into soft thermo plastics like vinyl to create channels, then pressing Saran wrap(half mil film of PVC or LDPE) or silicone or PMMA across the top with adhesive to make a flexible or rigid top.
