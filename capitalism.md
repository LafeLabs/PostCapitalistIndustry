## Section I: Why?

What is best in life?  
To care for one another, and to have adventures.

Technology can help us do both these things, building societies where all physical needs are taken care of as well as which perserve the adventure that makes life worth living.  However, as technology has advanced it has increasling served its own needs.  It has such a powerfuly overall positive effect on the human condition that we have let the rules of technical progress dicate the rest of our society.  As I discuss in the next section of this chapter, I have some theories I will present here about the nature of this technical progress structure and how it's falling apart.  

This section outlines the goals of the overall work, the overall ideas, and how the work here will be structured.  It is an introduction which focuses on the purpose of the whole thing.  

## Section II: The Machine

What is Capitalism?  

What is capitalism?  This is something that critics of it weirdly avoid a lot of the time.  If you look up various definitions, it generally goes something like this: Capitalism is the economic system in which the means of production are privately owned."  I hate this definition.  


* mining
* military 
* monotheism
* misery


What this definition implies is that the opposite of capitalism is someone other than "the private owners" or "the capitalists" owning the "means of production", and "economics" being based on something other than private capital.  I put all these things in scare quotes becuase I see them all as subtle weapons to inject hidden ideology into poeoples minds by the very wording of the definition.  First of all, the anarchist rejection of capitalism rejects ownership of minerals, land, and machines.  So any defintion that talks about "who owns what" should already be rejected by the anarchist, and we have already ceded a major point by allowing this definition to stand at all unexamined. Capitalism is a system in which some people, called "owners", claim to have power over certain things which they claim the right to carry out by force if needed.  Capitalism is a system in which a military state exists which both feeds of the system of privately owned extraction and enforces the power strucutre that governs it.  

The "means of production" is also a problematic phrase.  While it is a bit ambiguous, I see this phrase as at least potentially implieing that this the "means" is some sort of fixed infrastrcture.  The implication is that "the means of production" is a thing that exists outside of economic systems, which can be controlled by any of various types of government or state.  This is total bullshit.  The very structure of "production" in today's society is what I would call capitalism. The Soviet system, the various Fascist systems, "democracies", dictatorships, monarchies, I would say every single one of them is capitalist.  They all have this basic structure of military power creating a monopoly of force that protects a vast system to extract mineral wealth and destroy it as fast as possible by constant threat of violence.  To me calls to "seize the means of production" sound like calls against a king to go seize the palace and tell the king what to do but to keep the palace and king in place.  It's the same system, with slight changes.  So to let the capitalists define these ideas gives them a victory before a debate even begins: it allows that the existing "means of production" should continue to exist.  A true challenge to capitalism is one in which the very concept of production is reinvented.  It means building industrial technology from the ground up around different values.

Another problem with the notion of "economic system".  I would argue that economics is again a part of the intellectual descendent of the basic idea of the One God of monotheists.  There is a Uniersal Heirerarchy that exists, which allows numbers to be used to asign value to things.  Human value becomes a number, always either less than or greater than or equal to any other numerical human value.  Part of rejecting the basic ideas of capitalism is to reject this heirerarchy cast down from God.  But to even use the phrase "economic system" again lets capitalism be defined in a universe in which nothing other than capitalism exists. 

Indeed in some of the definitions I've found online they even add phrases like "as opposed to State ownership of the means of production".  In other words the supposed definition of capitalism used by most people is not a definition of capitalism at all, but a clever propaganda piece that creates a world in which the alternative to capitalism is another type of capitalism which is re-cast as the Socialist Enemy.  Since I consider all the Soviet style "communist" countries to be capitalist in their philosophical worldview, I find it not surprising that they hold the same warped view of this false dichotomy.  The communists can point to "capitalism" as their enemy, where "the ruling class" "own" the "means of production", rather than "the dictatorship of the proletariat".  When this goes to shit like it always does and destroys the environment even worse than "capitalism", people on the right say "I told you so" and people on the left say "it will be different next time! it's all Stalin's fault!".  

So if we really want to move beyond capitalism, criticisms of it need to start trying to really see it for what it is, and see just how far the viral ideas about God that underly it have wormed their ways into the very language we use to describe it.
