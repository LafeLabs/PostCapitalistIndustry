## Moving Beyond Money

Money is a failure.  I have gone into some detail about this in the earlier chapters and I will attempt to not belabor it here.  How, exactly does it fail, though?  I say it's wrong to add up human value using numbers, but what exactly is the mechanism by which this causes so much misery?  There are many mechanisms, but one that I think is worth starting this chapter off with is its dissipative nature.  As money flows through our society it dissipates.  At each stage from the banks out through all the people working and selling things and paying each other to when it comes back to the bankers, money is "lost" along the way, usually to various parasitic organisms like landlords and online payment gateways that add no value but simply take from the system.  

So one feature I believe we need to look for in a value system beyond money is that it should be additive rather than dissipative: rather than transactions making value decrease, as they do for both money and the physical goods capitalist claim as "property", we want value to *increase* as transactions happen.  This goes against everything capitalism stands for, as it doesn't work with currency based on integer numbers, mining or human misery, but that's the point.  The fact that there is "not enough money" to do all the many things that need doing in our society is partly because most of us do not have the ability to make it.  We can get it from someone else, but ultimately they had to get it from someone who got it from someone who got it from a banker and of course all those transactions paid the dissipations tax to the various parasitic rent collectors. We can't just sit down, think really hard, make a thing, talk to some people and *make* something of value.  We can make a thing then sell it for money, but that is no longer a closed system.  If there are just the two of us, alone in the woods we cannot create value in the money based system without also involving a banker.  Any system of value that we use to replace money must have the ability to grow in value and scale in a closed system, without any need to communicate with bankers, governments or others of their kind.

It is also worth at least mentioning the so-called "alternatives" to money in the form of electronic currency like Bit Coin and the "time dollar" or other currencies based on selling hours of your life away.  These are all still money. They use numbers to represent value, and address almost none of the underlying problems with modern money.  


In the special case of Bit Coin the creators have actually managed to build perhaps the only money system worse than central bank debt currency. They have replaced central bankers with members of the technocratic priesthood who answer to no one and are some of the most unpleasant and anti social people in our society.  And they have replaced an inflationary system with a deflationary one, making currency ever more scarce as time goes on.  I wish I were creative enough to have invented Bit Coin as a sort of counter example of technocratic capitalism gone mad, must like the Schroedinger's cat story used to show the absurdity of quantum superposition(which still appears to accurately describe the world). It would have been a great thought experiment to show in a series of amusing anecdotes just what a horrible idea this is, but alas, this is not fiction and we all have to deal with Bit Coin people for the foreseeable future.  

## Infinite and Infinitesimal Value

When you say you want to move beyond money for keeping track of value, the capitalist will typically turn purple and start spitting about how absurd the very idea is of doing anything like this.  They have been trained to do this, and it's a part of the immune system the capitalist machine has built up over the centuries.  However, they know perfectly well that values without any numerical equivalent are quite common in and essential for our society in even its current form.  Our society and indeed all societies have concepts of value outside finite number.  Both "priceless" and "worthless" items are quite common in any system.  


That which is called "worthless" by capitalists are often the feeds we will use as "Trash" in Trash Magic, infinite supplies of things given zero numerical value by the capitalists.  Returning to the example from a earlier chapter, the dog turd on the side of a street is an example of something viewed as "worthless" or "trash" by the capitalists. To take this example farther, what would it look like to attempt to apply capitalist "economics" to the dog turd?  Over some days it will be digested by insects, bacteria and fungi.  Once some atoms from the turd have been consumed by a fly, does the fly own them? Who owns the fly?  Or perhaps the fly is a liability, whose is that?  If the fly is eaten by a bat who then uses those calories to also eat the mosquito which was going to give me malaria surely the fly is now an asset, but whose?  Mine?  Or the bat?  But who owns the bat?  And if I return to the turd a couple weeks later and it's gone, did it "depreciate" to use the jargon of accountants?  Depreciating assets can generally be written off as a discount on your taxes in most countries.  How would I do that for the dog turd?  Perhaps if the turd was on land that I owned and I had a numerical tally of the molecular wealth in the turd I could then calculate how fast the flies are taking away this great wealth and somehow turn this into numbers and then a tax write-off.  But surely the molecular wealth in the bellies of the well-fed flies are now an appreciating asset.  Is that then to be taxed?  Who owns the flies? It's all just nonsense!  The vast universe around us of "worthless" things proves the extreme limitation of the capitalist worldview to even basically describe our environment.  

But what about the "priceless"?  This is also an extremely familiar concept in every capitalist society and is also one in which their methods of assessing value completely and catastrophically fail.  When it applies to an individual this is usually called "sentimental value", and applies to well-loved personal things.  This might be a t-shirt which was purchased for very little and is too worn to still wear but which was worn on some long journey.  More often themes valuable personal treasures are those which were given to us by others.  We also use the concept of priceless to refer to those things with shared cultural value.  Perhaps a capitalist can put a numerical price tag on things like the various stone temples of our different human societies from centuries past, but we all know that is not the real value.  When a ancient temple valued by the local government at some arbitrary number of units of bank debt is destroyed no one in the world would dare say that this is really the same as that much bank debt being destroyed.  It's not the same, because there are values in these cultural artifacts which cannot *ever* be added up using numbers.  

An example of priceless value familiar to some students of American popular culture is from the film Pulp Fiction from the 1990s. A character played by the spectacular Christopher Walken presents a watch to the son of his dead friend, and in one of the greatest monologs recorded on film explains the priceless nature of the watch in the form of a story.  The story is not about the watch itself but about what happened to the watch--it's not really about the thing but the people.  The watch ends up representing a four generation story of a male family tradition of warrior values.  Within that culture it has truly infinite value.  All this is shown as a flashback for a main character, to explain why he is willing to lose everything including his own life to save the watch.  None of that is to tell time, to store value for retirement or to hoard metal.  The value of the watch is *entirely* based on human values and cannot possibly be translated to finite numbers.  

I would propose a system of values based on these ideas, where we all have our own personal Christopher Walken in the history of the things we hold dear telling the best possible stories which give things value the capitalists cannot possibly add up with numbers.  There are many ways to do this.  In the end what all of them have in common is that they lead to a value system that takes more from the study of folklore than from the study of numbers.

## Magic Tales and Magic Lore

I’m changing the name of the post capitalist system from “value circles” to something closer to “magic stories”.   “Value” is a problematic word since it sounds too much like an equivalent of the capitalist economic system.  I think it invites too many annoying capitalism questions, and points the wrong way.  And “circles” was maybe a bit of a nonsense word in the way I was using it.  What the hell does that even mean?  So I’m dropping both words.

One possibility I’ve been kicking around is “narrative”, but that sounds too impersonal, and too technical.  I think “magic” sends the right message since it is so clearly a turnoff word to engineers.  One thing that is clearly emerging here is that engineering as a discipline and engineers as a culture are my enemy here.  They are an important part of the immune system of the Capitalist Monster that we are all parts of.  It is no accident that engineers like to tear down everything anyone says all the time, being among the worst “mansplainer’s” on the planet.  This is because that’s where the rubber meets the road for capitalism protecting its interests.  The asshole male engineer who always tells you you're wrong and nothing will work is really capitalism’s immune system, and in that context their behavior makes perfect sense.

Possibly “tale” is better than stories.  “Magic Tales” could also then be abbreviated to “tales”, which inevitably it would be. After all, when one says “tale” instead of “story”, does that not tend to imply Magic?  I think it does.  Maybe where this should all end up with is “tale”.

TALE:  this is really remarkably easy to understand, and removes the hard anti engineer bias of “magic” with something more flexible.  Every thing has a tale, every person has a tale, they are all woven together.  Perhaps Lore should also be used, and there is a lore data channel and a tale data channel.  Lore is how to build a thing, where to get more, technological data.  Tales are the story this specific thing.

Lore and Tales shall replace economics, and this becomes easy to understand and explain without getting mired in pointless discussions about capitalism.  Because telling stories and lore has always existed outside of capitalism, and can co-exist from the beginning.  I’m pretty sure HTML5 is the format, at least for now.

This is part of how Trash Magic can drive wedges into global capitalist culture: we inhabit the strange corners of the current capitalist regime where property-based values have not totally extinguished all goodness.  These include in the water, where property law is more flexible, and in folklore as opposed to capitalist media, where IP has not taken over the culture and suppressed creativity.

Note: I'm increasingly thinking that both the tale and lore should be mostly oral.  There will be graphical constructions to show how to do stuff, but I think the combination of oral and graphical might be superior to the written word for this, because I want the doing of things to spread, rather than the empty talk.  You have to be face to face to really teach someone this stuff, so why not keep it offline with exchanged files not on a techfuck server?  It won't slow down transmission of real stuff so why not? It will slow down the spread of people talking about our ideas but doing nothing, but that's a good thing.  I want 100% participation: you either walk away or you actively participate.  Reading blogs and even doing instructibles in your basement in your house is not that. Those "makers" are of no use to this movement except as a source of some materials and instructions in our early days.  Images and oral transmission is something I can actually do.  And this book.  Fuck Github.


### Currency Diagrams
This will be pictures not words.This is now how I see “the system”. A circle of debt and power links all people with business and finance to be deployed as needed to support the military industrial complex. I no longer believe in the words “money” or “government”. These are both fictions. There is only debt, power, and the military industrial complex. All of this exists to use fire to turn earth into debt and power and complete the cycle. Denominating that debt by numbers which have power unto themselves without the whole cycle is a unspoken State Religion adopted by all modern states and corporations.
This is what value should look like:People do labor using industrial “waste” of the old system until it’s all cycled through the new system, using ambient energy which comes originally from the sun, and the living ecosystem that is supported by and supports that cycle in circles of value. Circles can be formed large and small, and involve trust between members of the circle which is initially fixed and which has a finite lifetime. Circles can have any of many different possible rules and structures, can live for a long time or very briefly, etc. They might have as part of their interior various physical artifacts or not, or various mathematical artifacts or not.
Circles may intersect in nodes which can have their own sets of rules. The level of complexity of the infinitely expanding system of value circles and nodes and networks has no serious theoretical limit. I imagine that the amount of data required to denote a value circle is always going to be small, even with some fairly verbose ASCII formatted text about background, stories and rules etc. Media might be needed which could take up a lot more space, but that should all be linked to from the core value circle object.### Creation of ValueSuppose I have a motor I have built, and you have need for a motor. Suppose I have built 1000 motors so I can easily spare a couple for your robot. You need a robot, I can give you a robot, so of course I give you a robot. Together, we have created value in the world in this transaction because you having a robot and me having 999 robots is much more useful than me having 1000 robots and you having zero robots. MUCH more!
Right now we have two choices: we can just call it a gift, hand you the robot, and I can feel like a nice guy. Or I can demand some “money” for it, after which we say I “sold” the robot to you. I put scare quotes around these words, as I often do, to denote that I’m about to reject the assumptions of these terms.

 When people say “money” they mean debt from the Federal reserve bank, or some other central bank. That debt has value because it is backed by the military might of the United States, which accepts that debt in its collection of taxes. But this is fucked. Why should we need debt from some military backed bank in order to do this clearly positive transaction? Surely just doing this adds value to society and we should be able to denote that without federal reserve debt. But there is not necessarily any motivation for anyone to make that possible.
 So what is the alternative? It seems that the most common alternative is the Marx-influenced concept of the time dollar. A local currency can be created based on hours of labor which can be exchanged through a community without any government involvement, taxes, or any banks. But that is of no help for our robot transaction. My robots were built by robots and took no labor. When you get the robot, it will do labor so you don’t have to. By carrying out a transaction that saves labor, we’re decreasing the value available in the system according to Marxian labor theory of value. Anything that makes life easier creates deflation in a labor based currency, which users of federal reserve debt can attest to the horror of.
I propose that a usable way to communicate value outside of bank debt will involve the ability of people carrying out a transaction to simply create a marker of the value they mutually created. I also propose that fancy math will not be the basis of this. Especially fancy math backed by faith in libertarian neck beard fucks(you know what currency I’m talking about). It will be based on trust. Trust of the people involved in the transaction, which moves like a bubble through the untrusted mass of society.I propose that one way to do this is for a transaction to be a chapter in a story, and that that story caries the value. So it works like this: I give you a robot. We write a very short story about this, why we did it why it was a good idea, why the robot is cool, etc. Short, to the point, with some details. Now, I can take this story down to the coffee shop and say “hey, man, can I have some coffee, I gave someone a robot today!” They say “yeah, you can have coffee here for the next week or so for a robot, sure. That’s the next chapter of the story. They pass that along to their milk supplier, who adds another chapter and sends it to the fence post company, who takes the longer story to an affiliate coop out in the country who is part of our network, who delivers a much more substantial wood processing robot machine. A real monster. And so on.
It’s not a fully formed system, but I don’t think a good system ever really will be. It’s worth a try, better than nothing, better than federal reserve debt.

### More on Value CirclesAnother element of the value circle currency concepts is myths. Myths, legends, narratives, call it what you want. One way to create shared trust between members of a value circle is to have shared culture, or folklore.
Do people believe these to be actually true? Maybe. Maybe it doesn’t matter. My view is that existing money already has a weird religious belief built in of the most dangerous possible kind: that which people don’t even acknowledge IS a belief. The entire world view created by the monetary system where everyone has to exchange central bank debt is not related to physical, social, or biological reality. It’s a artificial creation which harms most of the people who without having a choice or even understanding that they made the choice are forced to live their lives by it.

 One way to combat what is essentially a very conservative religion is to form a belief system outside it, making the transition from the money belief system to a new one more explicit than just “losing faith” in money which does not force the concept of money to be treated as a religion.
 What would be an example? I think initially they would tend to fall into two categories: fan fiction and religion. One of the easiest ways to build a mythology of a value circle is to do something like base things off of Star Wars or Supernatural or something. It helps when people know a thing well enough to have a shared reference easily right from the start. For people who already have some sort of religion, building a trust network based on that both formally and informally is an obvious way to get started. Of course other values would be shared by a value circle, including technically specific elements like “meters of 24 AWG copper magnet wire”, but on top of the specific parts, I believe having something less quantitative and more personal is useful. More on this later, this ongoing stack of aspects to the Value Circle.



### On Money and Additive ValueI hate money, and also love it, and that is typical of people in our civilization. I’ve thought a lot about all that over the last year of my total personal disillusionment with capitalism. I’m definitely against most of how our “economy” works, and definitely in favor of something else, but it’s hard to even know where to start with all that.One habit I’ve acquired over the last few months of reading and thinking about anti-capitalism is replacing the word “money” in my mind with “federal reserve debt”. That’s literally what it is, and constantly reminding myself of that helps me to think clearly about the world around me and what to do about it.
One thing that I hate about money that I want to raise here is that it is dissipative. When a transaction occurs, one party transfers their federal reserve debt to another in exchange for some more real good or service. That transfer has all kinds of losses in it. First of all, in the money system the most value that can possibly exist after the transaction is the amount you started with. Until another party is brought in, in a single transaction, the amount of federal reserve debt always goes down, just as the amount of entropy always goes up in chemistry.
Looking at a system like this it’s clear that the best way to accumulate federal reserve debt is to be the dissipation. One way to do this is literally to take something from the transaction, which is what paypal and banks and credit cards and the rest of the finance industry do. Another is to make money off taxes, as the military industrial complex does. And a third is to be a middle man in the information channel from seller to buyer, by being in the advertising/marketing industry. And indeed I argue that these three types of accumulation are the main power lines in our society: military, finance and marketing. Plenty of power and wealth accumulators are all three or some combination, but I argue that most power in our society is based on these three pillars because they are the optimal means to accumulate federal reserve debt. Everything else loses to these dissipations and eventually feeds someone in one of these three pillars more than your little project possibly ever can accumulate.
It is not so much my goal here to attack the concept of central bank debt, taxes, etc. as to think about how to get outside this to add and exchange value without that system. What I argue is that a transaction should add a note of value to both sides, not just one, and that it should require no value on a balance sheet before the transaction. This second part is extremely critical. One of the crippling problems of our current system is that it prevents anyone from being self sufficient, ever. If some group wants to exchange goods and services in a closed economy they need to first get federal reserve debt from the outside in order to even have units of currency with which to work. Add dissipation to that, and eventually they’ll always be more and more dependent over time on the outside world, and be forced to participate in global capitalism. A system that addresses these problems must allow parties to agree to do a thing, do it, and create from nothing the value that can be further passed along to the rest of society. Another critical flaw in the money system is the negative value of work. We assume that in any work transaction there is a winner and a loser. E.g. at a gym everyone has to either pay or get paid, it’s assumed that the coaches are losing something and the athletes are gaining, so they are on opposite sides of a neutral or net-negative(with rent and taxes etc) transaction. But surely the coaches also gain? Are they not also athletes? And the athletes are working just as hard, why is their work somehow “opposite”?
All this is cleared up by the additive currency concept. Here a transaction creates a value pair, with half taken by each party. Thus when a personal trainer meets with an athlete, they each walk away with a unit of value equal to one times the value of that transaction. Let’s now go back to my motor factory supply chain. An urban scavenger rolls up on their bike with a big bin of copper wire, and we each record that that was of value and changed hands. They then take that value token to the local coffee shop who pours them coffee and both sides get the coffee transaction token. The coffee shop buys a coffee grinding machine using one of our motors from one of our customer factories, more tokens are generated on both sides. The coffee shop takes this new hoard of tokens and pays their workers, and this payment also generates value on both sides, further accumulating the wealth of the coffee shop who is a major pillar in all this. The grinder factory trades with us for motors in bulk, and some bulk material transaction value is again created on both sides of the sheet.
There is a strong analogy between this system and the so-called h-index used in academia. The h index is designed to create a measure of the success of an academic career based on the combination of two factors: how many times has someone published and how much are those publications cited. The idea is to avoid valuing either the one paper that gets 1000 citations or the author who publishes 100 papers a year none of which are ever read. Authors who both publish often and get frequently cited are, on average, going to be the biggest contributors to value in the field. For better or worse, h-index ends up having real value that can get turned into federal reserve debt by having an impact on hiring and promotions of academics. It’s not a perfect system by any means and is widely abused by departments but I think it’s an interesting proof of principle that this idea can be useful.
A missing part of all this is a proposed implementation strategy. How should the value be accounted for? I could think of a lot of ways to do it but I want to make the point that I think this is much less important and difficult than a lot of techno nerds want you to believe. Any store of value, whether it’s paypal, cash, or credit card debt is basically based on trust. Sure, there are anti-counterfeiting measures on bills and encryption on online transactions. But for the most part these systems work because most people can be trusted most of the time. If everyone really were out to steal and cheat, encryption would be nowhere near enough to save it, and it would collapse instantly. All this works because the VAST majority of people would rather do something useful than go into the illegal bill printing business or credit card theft. One way I think it could be done is with an archive of stories. Some kind of shared electronic narrative that includes all the transactions in the network. This is not great for doing illegal shit or avoiding government surveillance, and that is a problem in some ways. But not in the long run because it forces people to push back against the government controls a lot harder and faster and also because that stuff can always still happen with federal reserve debt, alternate and more anonymous systems, etc. Clearly there will be others for whom this doesn’t work. But I believe that a story- database-based system of value can work for some people. And if it works for anyone it’s instantly extremely powerful because it will grow exponentially and naturally find the people who can benefit from it most. Is it taxable? Probably not. If we do things “for free” meaning no federal reserve debt is exchanged at all, what is there to tax? Surely not vast, unencrypted databases of anecdotes and poems describing the actions of millions of people.
And it’s not even really necessarily a threat to the government tax system, I think. Part of how our system is as broken as it is is how differently it serves those who control the pillars of power from the rest of us. The fact is that the capitalist overlords, governments, military machines etc. don’t really need the vast majority of us to exist. Our demands for food, medical care, housing etc. are mostly an inconvenience to them. An economy like this might take what looks like potential tax revenue out of the system, but it also takes an incredibly vast load of social welfare spending off of the existing system, since that kind of value is so much better created in the additive value system.One more point is that I don’t consider bitcoin to be in any way relevant to fixing the money system. With any form of currency, you have to ask “who do I trust when I place trust in this?” I have lots of criticisms of the central banks, and the federal reserve in particular. But given the choice between central bankers and some neck beard fedora software montherfuckers, I’ll take the central bankers any day of the week. Because the demographic in charge of bitcoin is, in my view, the single least trustworthy group that exists in our society. Also, building deflation into a currency is so bizarrely pathological it’s not even worth looking at. Bitcoin isn’t money, neck beards are not revolutionaries, it’s time to move on.
So where do we start? I think I want to build a supply chain out of trash, and then just try the database of stories method and see what happens. Having a supply chain that is clearly of value will give me the leverage to start a thing like this. So probably another year or two are required, and hopefully by then I’ll be more comfortable with python and will be able to build a prototype software system to start this off.


### Free Feed of the Value CirclesPeople love their feeds. Facebook, Twitter, Yammer, news feeds, tumblr feeds, text message feeds, push notification feeds. It has proven to be a very widely liked format for a person to see the passage of time of a community of people. Value circles should include this feed concept. Working on your stuff will add media content from your device which gets added to the main value circle database and then fed into various users’ feeds based on their filter choices. I think if you are not trying to make money that this whole thing can be much simpler than the existing software and that Facebook etc can be replaced. However, it’s also possible that the best first implementation of this will be to do it in a existing commercial system like Facebook. This is obviously dangerous. Dealing with companies like that can have legal problems, control problems, and limitations on what you can do practically. It’s not ideal, but it’s something to consider. And the free feed that circulates and shares data to a web browser that can be loaded on the pi zero tablets of the trash wizards is a project that should be worked on immediately. Probably tools already exist that can be adapted for this task. This is worth some detail in the first book, it’s not physics, it’s code and that’s faster to deploy.

### Courier system

I need a courier system to facilitate movement of goods as well as skills without shipping costs


### Also value trees

Is the circle the best geometrical metaphor?  Sometimes.  But I should generalize the concept of geometric metaphors to include the spiral, the pentagram, the tree, the fractal, the sphere, the torus etc. etc.  trees have roots and leaves and branches and a trunk and sap and sun and soil and water.


###	Trash Wizard Interaction with Capitalist Economics
We all have to live somehow, and most of us  can't just sink beneath the waves and escape capitalism overnight.  We need money to pay rent to live in a city where our loved ones are, to pay for medicine, get around on capitalist transit etc.  How do we do this ethically without just selling out?  
Here are the rules for Trash Wizard capitalist interactions:
1.	Try not to buy raw materials and other peoples labor, salvage trash and rely on mutual aid for free, and build your own stuff
2.  To make money, selling labor is best, then selling stuff made from trash, always try to avoid labor and materials arbitrage: don't buy stuff then sell it don't pay people then re-sell their labor.  
3.  Do not sell misery, try to only work on things that are fun, while they stay fun, each product or service should be an ADVENTURE.

We create.  As long as our fed debt money comes from our labor and trash, we will always have a net gain of capitalist currency into our system, making hte sign of the dderviavie right.  sell one off art pieces for high prices.  All my pieces should be unique.  

### Specifically The Post Capitalist Sex Industry

Let’s imagine a sex industry, with the word industry used, and inside the capitalist system but without actual capitalism.  What do I mean by that?  I mean that people who work make money but that they neither work for a capitalist nor function in that role themselves.  By “capitalist” I mean someone who pays one price for something and then sells it at another price, whether that is wage labor or materials or outsourced services.  Usually they use some economy of scale to allow themselves a monopoly enforced by the usual forces of armed capital.  Exchanging things of value for currency is not capitalism in that sense, as long as you don’t have to spend money for it.

I will now sketch out a “business model” for an anti capitalist sex industry collective using Trash Magic.

First of all, how do you want work in this system to work?  Really what you want is to get paid about $2000 for each sex event, to do it with a bunch of your hot porn star friends who are into cool stuff and live in your cool neighborhood, and to make art together and also build something that useful, combining art and beauty.

So let’s say that the goal here is to have about 6 people get together for a queer techno art orgy and each make about 2 grand.  That means you need to make a total of about 12 grand.  And you want to build a set of artifacts which you sell for about 50 to 100 bucks, which a lot of people will shell out for if they dig what you’re doing.  That means you need to make, sell, and ship about 300 units.

So this orgy has to have the right set of robots and other machines so that 6 people can make 300 units of an art-tech artifact in some reasonable time.  Suppose this whole thing takes a relaxed afternoon to do, with all your stuff already set up in your Trash Magic Coven Space.  if we divide the number of units by the number of people it’s 50 units per person for the whole event.  If each person has about 2 hours of full participation in them before they get bored or tired, that’s about 25 units per person per hour, or one unit every couple minutes for each person.  That’s pretty efficient!  Very doable with automation, but really quite efficient and will require serious process optimization, which the orgy process can help make happen.

Ok, so suppose that after your leisurely drugs/industrial metal/manufacturing/art orgy you have made, and I’m going to boost the numbers here, 500 units.  You put those in an inventory file, which you only give to people you put on a vetted customer list.  Each unit contains physical media with video and other data of the orgy for pornographic purposes, and is a fully functional Trash Magic Stick.  The inventory system starts from scratch with each orgy, where each customer has a one time customer ID number randomly generated and never used again.  Customer and performer alike then line up times and places in the database to meet usually in public places, generally with several customers for one performer and place, with performers always traveling in pairs for safety to exchange the physical “art piece” for 50-100 dollars cash.  Thus each transaction is simply money for art, in small cash amounts(generally exempt from sales tax).  All transactions will be local, and performers will courier the inventory by bike around town.  The number of customers is about 300-500 so for 6 performers each one can plan on about 3 distribution events each with about 20 customers.  So it’s a second afternoon, on top of the first, and with a good number of people for the events, easily each person could make 2-5k for a couple days of work.  If you did that about every two weeks, you could make 50-100k/year, enough to live a comfortable life where you spend 80% of your days doing other free art and science and the remaining 20% having orgies with your hot art/tech friends.

Many of us will end up doing serious R&D during that other 80% of the time, enabling our factory to make more and more advanced stuff.  After a few years of R&D I could imagine the customer getting a portable medical imaging machine and some synthetic insulin with legit quality control for their 50 bucks cash.

But what about the current clients, the horny old men with tons of cash, the sexually disappointed owners of capital?  They have to pony up much more than cash if they expect to get what they want.  They want some kind of elaborate pro domme fantasy? Ok, sure, but they’re not going to hand over a stack of federal reserve notes, they’re going to give you 80 tonnes of shipping space on their next freighter out of hong kong and 10 tons of rare earth magnets for your motor production.  If they want to use their position as controllers of the means of production to get sex from younger, more attractive, and less broken people, that’s all fine but they’re going to actually hand over those means of production not some bank debt funny money.

Examples of what clients might hand over would be vast quantities of raw metal, permission to work on private land without rent, and a lot of long haul transport.  Given that some captains of industry actually know something about industry, this might even not be that bad for performers, especially if people were well matched up in interests.

Also note that all this will be art.  As fast as we’ll be moving on the assembly line to both have sex and guide the rumbles of robots, we’ll all also be working on the artistic process of shaping how the products actually look, as well as putting on a performance that will be in the final media.

In the beginning, obviously my fantasies of MRI machines and nano drugs is not realistic, so what will we actually make first?  The Trash Magic Stick will be the first product. This is a simple artifact about the size of a large walking stick, which can do many tasks that require an electric motor.  It can be modified by the user to have a powerful sex toy, a mobile robot, a simple manipulator for 3d fabrication, a water pump, a evaporative cooling unit, and several other useful machines.  It runs off of ambient energy as detailed in my book, usually flowing water on site.

Yes, that’s another thing, the physical site location.  Ideally orgies will take place in an amphibious environment of floating trash boats in really nice weather, so that there is water power readily available both to generate electric current for electronics and to do work and to source water and other chemicals into the various industrial products.  So the Spring Orgy will be huge in this system. From the thaw of the creeks through summer might just be one continuous orgy, followed by just swimming and writing all summer and sleeping all fall.  Again, if we have the machines and robots we need, this is possible RIGHT NOW, under capitalism, living in a nice fancy apartment in a big city and drinking expensive coffee.

Oh, and how do we do that without getting the government coming after us for tax evasion? By paying our taxes.  Part of the infrastructure that should exist here is a automatic LLC formation and dissolution as needed for series of orgy/fabrication events.  A company bank account will be formed, money moved into it, taken out for taxes and distributed as dividends to all the equal co-owners, then dissolved.  So we’ll actually all be paying a very high tax rate.  But who cares?  We won’t be putting any money in, hiring anyone or working for anyone.

And this can also be scaled up quite a bit as high end pro doms fully deploy their network of clients to start getting their hands on larger quantities of raw metal and other critical process materials.  We want to avoid any materials getting mined on our behalf, because that will make this technology non-free.  However, if material is diverted *out* of the capitalist system in exchange for pro dom and other sex services that is a net positive.

Lastly I want to consider a use case of this model that’s scaled up a bit, to say 100 people.  This is something that could be done on a trash flotilla surrounded by yachts in the waters outside LA during a sex industry convention.  100 people come together and make, now with considerable economies of scale and sophistication, 500 units each over a week of work, with insane epic orgies of every possible variety.  So that’s 50,000 units.  And at this point each thing is really powerful, can do significant high tech shit the capitalists can’t do, like universal medical imaging.  So the performers sell them for 100 dollars each, easily, making a total of 5 million dollars revenue for the project(and gross = net because we spend zero money).   If you divide 5 million dollars by 100 people, you get $50,000 per person, enough to live a decent life on for the whole year without any other work, even after paying a high tax rate(which we should not have to do since this will be capital gains if we have a decent accountant).

Does that sounds like unreasonably high production rates? I  don’t think so.  Current manufacturing technology already has huge economies of scale.  If those same scale economies are used with the same physical basis of our technology but where everything is made from trash during orgies, and we keep the value, this is really a pretty modest production rate.  With that many people involved, we’ll have access to a ton of raw materials, land, computer infrastructure, machines of various kinds etc.  And is the number of 50,000 customers for this scenario realistic?  I think it is. With mass communication via twitter and the like, it should be possible to very easily and with no money spent to have the more marketing oriented performers connect up with that many people in a large metro area like LA or NYC, and then for each performer to personally distribute 500 units in sets of 50 10 times by bike around town.  Serious work, but doable, and in just a few days if all the infrastructure is in place.

With larger economies of scale and more high tech products, it will be possible to have the products sell for quite a bit more, as well.  Something very high tech that costs many 10’s of thousands of dollars(I really want to build a fucking MRI machine,really want to) might be built this way, making it still easy to sell the thing for 500 dollars in this model, making the take home for each performer more like $250,000, meaning they only have to do an epic sex manufacturing art science orgy like every few years if they want.

So this is how I propose the sex industry should work within capitalism.  It is a system where all performers are paid the same, make $50-250k/year for working a few weeks a year maximum, only ever have sex with their hot porn star friends, and don’t have to worry about cops or the IRS because no laws are being broken and taxes are being paid.  Legally, all performers are professional artists, part of a series of art-selling LLCs selling their own work built from trash.

How the fuck do we actually do this, you ask?  That’s my job: to build the robots and write the instructions so that you can do it just by watching some tutorial videos and downloading a bunch of free instruction files.  Give me another couple years and I think I can get this working, but I think for very small numbers of units and people I can get something working by fall of this year: making sex toys I mostly already know how to make, which just need a bit of work.  Art, though, all art.  Oh, yeah and free MRIs and the most powerful vibrators ever built, running on off-grid power.  Boom!

Also note that all this is Trash Magic.  So these are magic witch orgies, using all sorts of Trash Witchery, with associated Magic rituals involving the process of assimilating trash into the world of magic.
