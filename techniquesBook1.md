In this chapter I discuss the fundamental techniques that I have used and plan to use in the near future in the actual practice of what I call Trash Magic.  This chapter will change drastically in future revisions, and inevitably older editions of the book will look very dated as this part changes.  It is tempting to work on this for years and to withhold publishing this manuscript until these techniques actually work well and can be used to make a variety of really nice things.  But since a large part of the purpose of this manifesto is to provide my own guide for my work, I will plow ahead with some rather immature technology here, and it will be saved for posterity and will serve as a starting point.  

I begin with sticks, because they're fun and easy and do a ton of things. 


## Finding the Right Sticks 

Don't hurt the trees!  We want sticks that are no longer part of a living tree but which have not yet been consumed by fungi and other organisms which turn logs into dirt.  Drift wood is also often too far consumed to be of use, although this really depends on the drift wood.  What we want are freshly fallen sticks from living trees, mostly.  And we're looking for them to be between an inch and 2 inches in diameter, mostly straight, with not too large knots if possible.  

A lot of electronics projects are perfect for sticks about 1 inch around and 4-12 inches long, so gathering and preparing these is a good idea.  Load bearing parts for larger constructions should be more like 1.5 to 2 inches in diameter, or bigger in some cases.  

Do not be surprised if finding nice sticks is harder than you think it should be.  It can be surprisingly hard!  If you live in a humid place with a lot of rain and water and life, you'll find that sticks get rotten *very* fast.  Sticks that have been out in the weather for a long time in a dry climate might be rotten while still attached to a tree in a more humid place.  I've spent a lot of time using pine as well as maple at various times.  Pine is pretty soft which is nice for getting started, it can get frustrating to spend a lot of time trying to cut a maple or oak stick by hand, especially if you're just trying stuff.  

One more thing to mention about pine is that aside from being easy and fun to work and very common all over the world there is presently an epidemic in the American west of beetles killing large numbers of pine and spruce trees.  These trees, once dead, are simply a giant fire hazard that no one wants to deal with, making an unlimited supply of sticks for the Trash Magician to use should they choose to go forage in that area.   

## Processing Sticks Into Skeletron

After locating the sticks, you'll want to saw the ends off flat so that they're not jagged.  I often find that it's easiest to gather sticks by hand without carrying a saw with you when you go out.  You can often rip the branch off by leaning on it with your whole body, be careful you don't hit yourself in the face! 

I also find that for this stage it's good to have two hand saws: one is a big rip saw with huge teeth that very quickly will cut through wood but is specifically not intended for metal.  The other is a much smaller screwdriver-like saw with a more hacksaw like blade for easy carry and use on random materials including plastic and metal.  This tool is also useful for removing knots and branches from your main stick branch.  

Once you have your sticks of about the right size, you want to shave off all the bark.  This is done with any of various types of pocket knife, and I find it useful to have a multi-tool of the kind that is also a pliers and screwdriver and such for this.  Ideally you'll do this where the massive pile of bark and shavings will be useful for something, like grinding into sawdust which can be used for a compost reactor.  At the very least somewhere there is already mulch will mean you don't have to clean it up because it's adding to the existing mulch.  

Once your sticks are shaved and cut at the ends, you cut them to size, shave two flats, and then file the edges smooth(simply for making it nice, this is not really functional).  I generally shave at least enough flat space to make a nice point of contact when connecting them using the quarter inch bolts, so at least a half inch of flat space is called for, maybe more depending on the application. For simple electronics projects I'll tend to shave the stick down until the whole thing is about half an inch or maybe 3/8ths of an inch thick.  

Finally, I generally drill a series of holes down the middle through the flat, spaced by at least an inch, sometimes more like 3 inches or more if I don't need many holes, or with one strategically placed at the "base" for an electrical project as a strain relief for the power cord(mentioned soon!)  At this time I drill the holes using a power drill and a quarter inch bit, generally clamping the stick with a c clamp to my work bench, which I drill holes in all the time.  My bench is a cheap door on a pair of sawhorses.  I also often use a small vice clamped to that bench for holding the stick while cutting holes.  Trying to cut holes with a drill without some form of clamp is usually a bad idea, is dangerous and is not recommended.  

## Finding the Right Plastic

I have found that the best plastic for our purposes is LDPE and HDPE which stand for low density and high density polyethylene.  They are indicated by the recycle symbols 4 or 2, and are mostly cross compatible.  

The easiest source of HDPE for most of us is bottle caps.  Standard plastic soda bottles which are made of PET or similar plastics that I find more annoying to work by hand usually have caps made of a opaque material which is typically some color like red or blue.  Anywhere plastic trash can be found, you can probably find these caps.  You don't care how much they have been smashed, but you do care a bit how dirty they are.  You can always grind or cut off the really gnarly dirt with a knife or file or similar sharp tool if there is too much crust on the cap.  It's generally a good idea to have a small bin filled with these caps near your work area.  

Another great source of plastic, which I use for small electronics work especially, is the translucent(but not transparent) plastic generally used for plastic milk bottles.  It is also used for various citrous juices such as orange and pineapple, so if you don't drink milk that's probably a better bet.  Some 1 gallon water containers from generic brands of bottled water also come this way, and those can be found in plastic trash piles by various creeks sometimes.  I avoid milk bottles I find that way due to what happens to milk when it's been out a few days.  I drink milk at home and when the bottles are done I try to immediately wash them out, rip them up, and put them in my plastic material bin.  

Finally, another source for LDPE for very large scale projects like building boats is traffic barriers, the big orange kind.  Don't steal them, they'll end up in the trash eventually, take those and cut them up with a hacksaw(they're too thick to cut with a regular knife, although maybe if you have a giant sword that will also work). 

## Plastic Welding

I'm sure there is a way to do this using really free tools, which I do plan to build.  However for now I'm using a very capitalist tool, the temperature controlled hot air rework tool which I also use for surface mount soldering.  It can be purchased for 50-100 dollars online.  I believe that a hair drier will also work, although the weld process will be harder to get right due to a lack of continuous temperature and flow control.  I set the temperature to 130 C.  If you're using a flame or hot air gun without temperature control it should be possible to measure the temperature to target that or just figure it out by trial and error, which is how I ended up at 130 C in the first place.  

The goal with working with HDPE and LDPE is to get it to transition from solid not to liquid(which you'd use to do injection molding, and that's well documented on youtube by others) but to glass, which lets you bend it and weld it but it still has structure.  When is it a glass? With the translucent stuff it's easy to tell: it goes from the milky translucent color to fully transparent pretty suddenly as it hits the glass transition which is actually very neat to watch!  Obviously all this is hot, so don't touch it, and be aware that it stays hot after you stop heating it for a few seconds at least unless you hit it with water or something to cool it down.  Just because plastic is below the glass transition doesn't mean a 100 degree C thing won't burn you!

As a first weld project I'd say take bottle caps, cut them up, heat them until they're kind of floppy, and are right next to the, moving the heat source back and forth between the two bottle cap shards, then when they're clearly a bit gooey, touch them together, and they should stick, then heat the combination a bit more, maybe another 20 seconds. Then when it's clear that they're both gooey and are sticking a bit, get your pliers or tweezers and start smashing and squashing to get the two to plastic parts to mix.  This is the same basic welding technique that is used for various food technology like the calzone: the weld joint on the top and bottom bread in a calzone looks just like the plastic weld joints you'll make with bottle caps.  


## salvage components from busted electronics

This section is going to be short because right now I still buy a lot of electronics from the capitalist enemy.  As capitalist enemies go, however, Digikey.com is awesome.  There are several companies that sell electronic components online, with fairly similar prices and selection.  If you want to compare them, the site to use is octopart.com, a startup company out of Boulder, Colorado which compares all the prices and stocks of the different companies.  That being said, I use digikey exclusively so that I can have a consistent bill of materials for everything, which uses digikey part numbers.  Digikey can often deliver a part to you within one day in most of the USA.  

As for salvage, the main electronics components I've been salvaging so far are power supply related.  I have found the the best way to get a power brick open is to swing it by its cord in a huge arc over your head and smash it on concrete repeatedly.  It's sort of like a particle accelerator, you want the largest possible swing with acceleration the whole way to get the maximum velocity of impact.  It's best to do this on clean cement with a broom so you can easily sweep up the bits as it explodes.  The plastic case will explode but the components should be largely unaffected by the smashing.  The good stuff in there is likely to include transformers, capacitors, diodes and bridge rectifiers.  Other things in there will be used more in future versions of this work.  

I will leave this section brief since it's very much a work in progress. I'd rather finish this book and then extend this later than delay the book while I do the research required to have good specs in this section.  

## how to solder

The best way to learn to solder by far is to find someone who can solder and get them to teach you face to face, it's a very physical learning process. One thing all forms of soldering have in common which I want to mention here is the need to get the actual metal being soldered hot, not just the solder.  The biggest mistake beginners make is not being patient enough in heating the other metals that are not the solder.  Also note that whatever is the most massive metal piece will need the most heat applied, be it by soldering iron or hot air gun.  

When I use the hot air gun to solder, it's always with solder paste, and I set the temperature to 230 C.  



## Sticks for Hydraulic Machines

This is another section that has to be a bit of a placeholder in this first version.  Sticks can be used to make various direct mechanical machines driven by water.  Water wheels made from simple arrangements of sticks should generate electricity to be used in that same apparatus, as well as to move various belts and cables to move things around in the world.  Water wheels should also be used as a replacement for many electric power tools, and a high research and development priority is building a power drill replacement that runs on water.  

## Sticks for fluidics

Ultimately, the stick technology should have fluidics built into it.  This means channels, chambers, pumps, valves, and electrical/chemical interfaces.  I've done some very crude experiments with this, but since nothing is really complete this is a place holder for now.

## chipping Rocks

We must bring back stone!  Not just for decoration but for weight, for fluids work, for electronics, and for many other applications.  Part of the Trash Magic skill set and tool set must be for simple stone work.  I have been pounding rocks with other rocks and reading a bit about this, but still have not fully developed the skills.  

## Measuring real time voltages and fluxes with an Arduino

Measuring voltages in real time should be easy.  And yet it's often a huge pain to transition from doing this in a over-equipped over priced lab to doing it as a rogue element.  The trick is to use the Arduino's analog to digital conversion, with the new Arduino software's very handy plotting feature.
