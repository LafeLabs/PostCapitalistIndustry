This book is about actually building things. This chapter is intended to
start that process. Since this is the very beginning of a rapidly
evolving system, this chapter will drastically change in future
versions, and it will be the least accessible of the chapters. If you do
not already have a technical background a lot of this chapter may make
not much sense. I hope it gives you some picture of what this will look
like at least in flavor even if not all the technical work makes sense
yet.

The idea is for all these technologies to reproduce and evolve and teach
their ways to new users as they spread through the world. So eventually
they will come to you and you will be able to make them!

If on the other hand you are a person who has worked with electronics
quite a bit and likes building that sort of thing I hope there is enough
detail here to actually copy this stuff. Do it! Make them, change them,
give them away, and teach others to do the same!

\subsection{Resonance Magic Stick}\label{resonance-magic-stick}

This machine is to make anything with a spring or spring like thing or
pendulum vibrate. Vibration is generally part of the physical phenomenon
known as resonance, which I will discuss much more in the next volume.
For now suffice it to say anything you think of as a wave or vibration
is probably an example of some kind of resonance.

The way to drive pretty much any resonance is the same: push only when
your push is in the same direction as the natural motion from the
vibration. We do this with magnets, which both serve to create something
to drive against with the drive coils and also indicate motion direction
to the circuit which does the driving.

When electrical current goes through a wire in a magnetic field, there
is a force on that wire. The wire also creates a magnetic field, and we
can think of this system as an electromagnet(which we turn on and off
fast) and a permanent magnet(which is always on) either being pulled
together or pushed apart(either will work).

Detecting the motion of the magnet is done using induction: moving
magnetic fields generate voltage in a coil of wire, which we detect with
an amplifier. That amplifier is designed to be all or nothing: if there
is even a tiny voltage, it will go all the way to 5 volts(the power
supply voltage used in elementary Trash Magic as well as USB), and at
below that(including negative voltages) it's stuck at zero. What this
means is that it essentially detects the \emph{direction} of motion of
the magnet. Linking the output of that amplifier to a power switch(this
role is played by a type of transistor in the first version presented
here) which controls current through the drive coil(the coil that
actually drives the magnet) causes force to be applied to the magnet on
only one side of the cycle of motion.

Perhaps this is all confusing. It's just an electrical way of doing what
you do when you push someone else on a swing: you see when they are
going forward and push then. Thats' all we're doing! But with a pair of
electrical devices, one of which takes the place of your eyes watching
the moving swing(that's the amplifier) and one playing the role of your
hand pushing the swing(that's the transistor and drive circuit).

The drive coil is a coil of wire about 1-2 inches in diameter with
200-500 turns of wire. This is 30 AWG(American Wire Gauge) copper wire,
and it's a few dozen meters, which makes it a few ohms of resistance. At
5 volts, this means it's generally 0.5 to 2 amps or so, that's the
target. The sense coil is 50 turns of the same wire, wrapped around the
outside of the drive coil.

The amplifier is a circuit using the MCP6241 operational amplifier, a
very low cost(less than a dollar), easy-to-use and generic chip from
Microchip, Inc.(also a very generic name!) The voltage gain is 10,000,
so 1 millivolt input is enough to saturate the amplifier all the way to
5 volts.

A core of ferromagnetic material such as steel ball bearings filled into
JB weld steel epoxy can increase the inductance considerably, and also
making it possible to drive steel or iron objects without permanent
magnets.

The strobe light is a high power small LED flashlight driven through
another identical power transistor, controlled by the output of a 555 in
monostable mode driven by the output of the amplifier. The user can turn
a knob that is a potentiometer that controls the time delay, generally
some number of ms or 10's of ms or 100's of ms. This strobe is thus
perfectly timed with whatever the resonant frequency is, and varying the
time delay varies what phase of that wave we can see.

The combination of a wave drive and a strobe has many applications in
both science and art. A wave tank can be made which projects water waves
in a shallow clear dish onto a large screen(2 m across), and waves can
be generated using the vibrational drive and a small agitator of some
kind(a wood stick or blunt wire will work). This can be an interesting
art piece that allows you to observe wave behavior with the strobe. Is
it art or science? Both. Also the strobe can be used in microscopy with
vibrating water, and the \emph{observed} position of a floating object
in the fluid can be controlled using the phase knob! This can be
extended into a whole world of optical microscopy, as well as other
phase controlled measurements in a vibrating fluid.

A phase controlled standing wave illumination can be used to make living
art by growing tiny plants in large arrays in such light, and
controlling the phase to control the relative illumination across the
green surface, making waves in the living plants. Many different art
pieces could be made like this, including growing bansai trees with this
illumination over a many year period to make trees with standing waves
of vibrational motion and light.

Art can also be constructed by making the strobe illuminate various
interesting steel objects which vibrate. This can also be used for pure
light art with more LEDs on the steel.

Vibrational drive can also be an alternative to rotational drive for
tools to work stone and wood. A coil with a iron core can be used to
pull on an iron nail on a spring, which then vibrates along the long
axis of the nail, making a sort of small steel jackhammer. Used under
water with patience and some automation, this could be a tool to slowly
and safely chip away at stone to make arbitrary shapes with minimal
energy or time or effort input. The same technology can of course be
used for wood.

Vibrational oscillators can also have a variety of applications in
massage and health, both for humans and other animals. Vibration applied
to various compost reactors and other types of chemical and biological
reactors can make a simple method for mixing or increasing reaction
rates. What effect does vibration have on microorganisms in loose soil?
Is it ever good? We must study this and find out.

Another simple vibrational machine that our driver can drive is a
pendulum with full swing. This can be as simple as a stick with a hole
in it and a metal rod as axle running through a plastic bottle stator,
with magnets on the ends of the stick. The driver will periodically
drive the magnets with just the right frequency and phase using feedback
as with the linear oscillator. This leads to an accelerating rotational
motor limited by the friction of the bearings, which has several
applications. One of the most useful is the high voltage generator,
where the rotation causes a rubbing between two materials that built up
voltage, and then metal pickups transfer charge to a big metal ball and
thousands of volts are built up which can be used for various things
such as plasma physics. These types of rotational pendulums are also a
nice demonstration of Josephson Junction physics and can be useful for
building models for that field of research.

Vibrational machines can also be used for simple propulsion of robots
and for pumps of both fluids and gasses. It is also amusing to see how
destructive resonance can be by putting magnets on glass things and
smashing them with the driver, which should be done very carefully if at
all!

\subsection{Noise Magic Stick}\label{noise-magic-stick}

This stick allows us to both listen to and create noise magic. Noise
magic has many forms, and we will work with several. First of all this
will be designed to measure the noise in tiny magnetic fields, amplify
it, and make audio noise for the human ear. This means you can literally
hear magnetic fields, and by brandishing your magic stick you can
control very sensitively what fields you're listening to: changing
direction with a tiny twist of the stick and location by waving it
around your head. Also this can be used to track AC lines with current
for various reasons, and can be used to trace underground signals, which
can be planted using thumper sticks.

Two stages of high gain amplifier and one stage of buffer amplifier get
from the detection coil to the speaker. All amplifiers and the speaker
are powered by a 5V source from any USB type supply and like the
Resonant Stick the input will be a USB cable. The top of the stick is
the speaker and the bottom is the pickup coil, with many turns and a
ferrous core. Potentiometers are used to tune so that all signals are
centered in the middle between 0V and 5V. This then goes through a
isolator to the last stage to let all AC through but not any DC into the
speaker. Large, obviously labelled, wires connect to the feedback
resistors in the gain stages, making it easy to make summing or
differentiating amps as well as oscillators. Magnets can be used to
couple vibration to electricity to sound, for direct vibrational
amplification. Knobs and switches can thus choose gain, keep DC at zero,
and make musical effects for art.

In the highest gain mode with a resistor at the input the stick can be
used to measure thermal noise of the resistor. This can be repeated for
various fluids, making a Johnson noise detector of fluid impedance which
should also be sensitive to drift currents from whatever is going on
electrically in the fluid. In addition to thermal noise there will be
shot noise observable from quantum tunneling through various native
oxide layers. This can be accomplished with an old beer can found by the
creek, immersed in a sports drink. Direct interaction with the
properties of the oxide using acoustic feedback should thus be possible
using quantum tunneling noise.

Properly wielded and modified, the Noise Magic Stick should be our ears
into a vast world of electrical impedance, voltage, current, and ion
magic in general. This is a precursor tool to the generic
electrochemical probe that will be made in Volume II of this work.
Again, with practice, it should be possible to do physical measurements
on arbitrary materials using the Stick, both electric and magnetic.

Another extremely important mode of operation for the Noise Magic Stick
is for optical pickup. A very simple and cheap optical sensor can be
connected to the input of the amplifier chain, converting an optical
signal to an audio signal. This can be used to demodulate voice signals
sent using fire and smoke and vibration in a faraway location. Optics
can be built into the stick to focus on a specific point, which might be
a transmission fire far away. Another magician may thus transmit via one
fire on a mountain top and be picked up and amplified as a loud acoustic
signal by many other magicians miles away in different locations! This
can also be done with fluids and at the microscopic scale with different
optics to create an audio signal from a microscopic system, generally a
biological one. We can thus listen to the motion of the cilia on a
moving protozoan for instance as an actual audio signal. This is both
art and science and also technology.

Finally Noise Magic gives us another useful resource: truly random
numbers. Using physical noise like thermal or shot noise we can have a
signal which is physically provably random which can generate numbers
using a simple analog to digital converter and microprocessor, at least
for now. In the future, the better way to do this would be to have the
random bits get directly encoded into something physical in multiple
copies which can then be used for a physical one time pad with no
interaction with any microprocessor ever. We can thus have provably
secure communication based on face to face contact, which can then be
deployed over any distance using the trivial one time pad encryption.
The attacks against the one time pad key generation generally involve
compromising the hardware in ways that involve access to the industrial
process by which that hardware was made. We make our own hardware as art
built from trash and then distribute it face to face, so these problems
to not apply. I don't generally believe in the cypher punk world view,
but near-theoretically-perfect encryption can be useful and it should be
so easy with our system there is not reason not to do it.

\subsection{Guerrilla Geometry}\label{guerrilla-geometry}

This will be the subject of future work, but I'm just going to give a
brief taste here in this first version. The three dimensional geometry
briefly described here when I discussed the ``tripod'' and Skeletron can
turn into a whole self reproducing art system which spreads globally and
which technology can be built on. Sticks, rocks and trash, who used with
the right geometric ideas can be infinitely strong if they pull humanity
into a new world of better life.

And that is the plan! Build viral information structures which go out
and change the world in such a way that humanity can live well in
freedom from the clutches of capitalism.
