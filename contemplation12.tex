\subsection{Twelfth Contemplation: Air}\label{twelfth-contemplation-air}

This is another purely meditative exercise, the octahedron is one of the
Platonic Solids and is one of the symbols used in alchemy to denote air.
Color this in and contemplate the infinite and free nature of air. Our
technology must become like air. Breathe it in!
