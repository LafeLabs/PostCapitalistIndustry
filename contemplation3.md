## Third Contemplation: Scroll

The scroll symbolizes the set of axioms we shall use to build all things.  

This is where we get pumped.  You re-read the principles, then put on get-pumped music and do a series of get-pumped exercises, like fast punches from horse stance or some axe kicks.  Alternate between coloring/sketching something simple on the scroll with severe activity of a martial arts nature around the area you are in.
