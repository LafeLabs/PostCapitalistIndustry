## Overview of Stages of Each Technology

Each technology goes through phases, and has equivalent milestones roughly following these stages:

1. Concept: starts in lab notebook, but needs to get entered into The Book somewhere, even if just in a cut and pasted blog post.  In later phases of Trash Magic this will start to look like a "pull request" in the sense that people can pose problems and other people can solve them.
2. design and construction chaos: this is going to always be poorly documented and exist in piles of trash on my desk and notebook notes.  This will probably become collaborative later on in the tale of Trash Magic, but for me it's a solitary process because that's how I work.  
3. Proof of principle demonstration, just showing the thing working.  This should be a youtube video with explanation and a blog post with photos on my official lafelabs blog
4. Prototype unit fabricated and clearly documented with another youtube and blog
5. Demonstration unit fabricated, which has one youtube video showing operation and another one showing assembly. A lore markdown file must exist documenting this whole process as well, more formal than a blog post, and existing on a online repository, linked to on printed label on the physical thing.  At this stage no automation is needed, just repeatability, it's pure art, a tale markdown file is also added for this first demo unit so that it  can have a life of its own
6. Production unit fabricated: this is documented the same way as the demo unit but now automation and scaling are added to the lore(even if they're not yet fully implemented, because this part has to always be a work in progress).  
7. Maximally free supply chain established. Might not be 100% free, but in all cases, identify source and minimum price, alternate sources, future free sources, path to all free version, clearly document supply chain in both tale and lore files, essentially this stage is an update of previous step with more and better data, and a few more production units produced and fully documented
8. Deployment: people have been actively trained to fabricate the thing, and have the capability to make it as well as a need to use it and a desire to propagate it further 
9. Afterlife: Tale and Lore continued into new artifacts that can be built out of all parts of existing artifact at end of life




## Various technologies, divided into phases


### Phase One

1. Basic stepper motor with button control and serial control
2. electrochemical probe with simple plotting on a tablet on a stick
3. generic plastic heat tool set with serial of temperature and LED for power
4. minimum possible water pump that can be measured for max flow and head pressure
5. minimum possible air pump that can be measured for flow and head pressure
6. generic dumb vibrator drive
7. hydraulic power that puts out 5 V regulated at up to 2 Amps, charges LiPo's
8. wind power that puts out same, charges LiPo's, is interchangeable with above
9. hoist control with string, z axis motion of one weight controls z axis motion with another connected to the output with wheels to get fine motion control.  Goal is about 300 micron control over a 5 cm range or so
10. skeletron core elements version 1, using commercial nuts and bolts still
11. grow onion roots inside slimezistor with silicone nub pumps and valves, demonstrate manual silicone pumps and valves


### Phase Two

1. vacuum pump that gets down to 100 mTorr or so
2. high voltage generator that can consistently charge a 1000 V capacitor and use the voltage, measure it
3. 3d heat working tool using z axis stuff above and heating tool above, demonstrate printing of QR codes
4. simple drone with phone control of two motors/wheels
5. simple helium or hot air or hydrogen flying drone with cell phone
6. simple two screw boat drone
7. underwater light powered by water current that goes forever, can be used to grow plants in a dark place under water
8. z axis POV robot, where user moves a phone camera around and can see what the probe sees
9. combine electrical and heat probes with optical imaging, move around in water and do basic things
10. universal, usable pumps for water and air, inflate bike tire with air pump, empty a bilge with water pump
11. universal dremel tool equivalent using motor
12. core trash magic stick first full version

### Phase Three

1. combine vacuum pump and high voltage with electrolysis generator and fluid pump to create gas discharge tube
2. Same thing with a heated reactor tube and a pile of dog shit to do CVD of methane
3. 3d printing and imaging with collagen and electric probe
4. scan and manipulate metal ions in and out of a circuit in electrolytic solution
5. fluid drones from above adapted to move in a fluid filled reactor tube
6. chemistry apparatus with pumps and valves and temperature control for biochem
7. build a motor factory that can produce all motor-made artifacts at scale, send out artifacts into value circles through classes and gifts and various other distribution systems
8. Trash Magic Stick with smart phone and drone capabilities, demonstrated scaling from seed of stick
9. plant and fungus and yeast growth and compost reactors using the fractal reactor technology

1. medicine fabrication
2. medical imaging and analysis, 
3. blood editing, 
4. organic computers and displays and communications, 
5. decentralized networking, 
6. data storage in trash, 
7. editing technology for microprocessors
8. catalytic probe with sub nanometer precision in a CVD chamber for custom carbon nano circuit fabrication, integrated with IC editing to grow organic electronics on existing trash 
9. scalable aluminum ion energy storage system
10. storm energy harnessing 
11. scalable submarine aquaculture infrastructure: lights and flow control
