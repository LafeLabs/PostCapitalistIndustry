In this chapter we start by learning about wires, then coils of wire, then magnetic fields around them.  Then we learn about magnets, then magnets and coils and force and mass and the. Tie it together with fields and units from previous two chapters.  

Experiments in the above part include first finding and measuring wire, examining insulation, winding coil, stripping resist, repulsion with battery.  Driving a magnet with driver board and battery.  Build some connectors out of trash to avoid soldering.  

Then from the practical experiments we build the motor and go through the circuit that drives it.  This leads to resonator experiments which lead to resonator studies in units and graphs and fields.  


# Wires

1. What is a wire?  Show photos of wires, talk about copper.  Metals, and magnetic fields. 
2. What is wire gauge, and how do we measure it?  How does this translate to resistance? Voltage and current with batteries

# Coils

1. How to wind a coil
2. inductance and resistance measurement
3. magnetic field and force, coil-coil force demo with battery

# Coils Driving Magnets

1. flip some magnets around, 
2. do a big and small coil, show various configurations
3. show how force drops off, graph the behavior, semi-log plots 

# Using coils to look at magnets

1. Make a small coil, connect to op amp, look at graph while waving a magnet around
2. repeat with a drive coil pulsed on, show the pickup, play with distance etc
3. magnet on a resonator, graph it

# Resonance and Feedback

1. Fire up the resonator and resonate everything
2. look at the graphs in the resonator, including bringdown
3. understand Q, f, omega based on graphs and feedback and bringdown 
4. study resonant vibrator

# Rotational Motion
![image](images/Anarchist_back_cat.jpg =100x) 

1. Some discussion of bearings, various examples, build a little cart that can roll around out of sticks and wires
2. use resonant vibrator to drive cart around, very simplest robot with directional control 
3. build the pair of double coils with reversible drive, use it to take a free magnet and rotate it step by step, with the buttons going to the next step in one direction or the other
4. put it together with a bearing, repeat experiment
5. run the spin with button version, with knob to set speed
6. use motor to drive wheels of little cart, most basic robot with wheels
7. build a coil winding machine, wind coils, show video of building a coil winding machine with a coil winding machine
8. create "dumb" rotational motor, discuss scaling


# Pumps

1. move a membrane in a pump like way very slowly
2. build the simple wood or plastic pump structure
3. add membrane, build driver stick and magnet unit
4. build fully working water pump, run around and pump water
