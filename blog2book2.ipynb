    "# Why I Hate Tech Bros \n",
    "\n",
    "I spend a lot of time in coffee shops working on stuff.  Meaning I don’t just drink coffee, I sit there fidgeting violently for hours at a time while trying to get a computer to do something or reading or thinking or designing a thing.  A ton of business of all kinds happens in a modern urban coffee shop. From multi million dollar startup deals to drug dealing and sex work to contract labor of all kinds to a huge fraction of our creative output as a society, coffee shops are a hub for all capitalist activities, and have been for centuries.  One of the main coffee shops I spend time in is next door to a loathesome tech startup incubator which also serves coffee, but has significant daily spillover into the shop I spend time in. Thus I end up overhearing a ton of their conversations and seeing exactly who is part of this modern phenomenon which for some reason is called “tech”.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing I notice about them is that their conversations have nothing to do with technology.  That is, if you hear a full hour of intense conversation from these people there is zero technical content ever.  No belly aching about code that doesn’t compile, no arguments about how to implement some type of machine, code, or circuit, no mention of any kind of “technology” at all.  Instead the talk is all about marketing, sales, search engine optimization(i.e. marketing and sales), various deals, office politics, and how everyone in the company(the customer is never mentioned) is feeling about all this.\n",
    "\n",
    "What the fuck is this?  To me, the technology business is interesting for two reasons: the technology and the customer.  Making cool things is fun, and is an interesting way to spend time.  And making things that improve the life of an end user feels nice because you’re doing good in the world.   As Mike Judge so astutely parodied in his show, all these “tech” startup bros have a pitch that mentions “making the world a better place”.  But once they actually get down to the day to day operation of their business the user is never mentioned, at least from what I’ve heard.  The mention the “customer” but only in the context of sales.  There is no empathy for the actual user.  To me the technology business should be an empathic process, where the creators do everything they can to figure out what their users really want or need, and doing this is a never ending challenge that should require intense discussion from before you start the company to 100 years after the IPO.  I’m not sure I’ve ever heard that–no anecdotes about the customer whose life has changed for the better, no cautionary tales about products gone horribly wrong for other customers.  Just “number of qualified leads”, “number of hits”, and various crowing about celebrity customers. So if you’re not talking about the customer, what the fuck are you doing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, that brings me to the other reason some of us are pulled toward working on technology: actual interest in that technology.  I think most of these people claim to be software people, so presumably that means things like algorithms,  various programming languages, IDEs, compilers, and libraries.  Computer science is a insanely rapidly developing field, and that development affects these people’s business model in a fundamental way.  So I expect to hear arguments and ramblings on all these subjects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nope.  Most of the time I can’t tell, even after a full hour of conversation, what technology is being used, who the customer is, what the product or service is, or indeed what sector of the economy they’re in besides “tech”(I’m going to keep using scare quotes because I’m so annoyed that these people have stolen this word).\n",
    "For comparison, I don’t see this in any other type of business conversation. When I talk business with people involved in our sex toy company we have to make sure no kids are in earshot because we’ll be talking vaginas, clits, nipples, leather, and lube all over the place.  You’ll have no doubt what we’re up to if you over hear us.  When I overhear the greedy real estate developers who are infesting Denver talk about their building deals, I see huge stacks of plans of actual buildings, and they’re clearly very passionate about actual things that exist on those plans.  Arguments happen around where some bushes will be put on the lawn, building code is mentioned, plumbing, constructing contractors, etc.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You have no doubt what these people are up to(building stuff) or who it’s for(people who will live in that stuff).  An extreme case of all this is the crossfit people, who are talking about their business deals usually in spandex, are insanely jacked with zero body fat, and go on endlessly about kettle bells–again, you have no doubt these people are about the cross fit first and deals and shit after that.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the modern tech bro is not interested in technology and doesn’t give a fuck about the customer.  But what are they all about, if not that?  From what I can tell, Homo Techbroicus is all about being inside their tribe, which makes money because that’s just what they do.  Their tribal markers are way more intense than other businesses.  I see groups of a dozen at a time blocking the sidewalk daily having their smoke break and the demographics are really remarkable.  Out of over 10 of them, 100% will generally be white men between 25 and 40 with facial hair.  100% of them dress in the standard modern tech bro outfit, and look the part of being in this tribe.  Technology has never been great at diversity but even by the low standards set by the last 50 years or so of technology culture this stands out.   I recently watched the movie The Forbin Project, a near-future sci fi from the late 60s.  One thing that stood out was both in terms of gender and race, the team that builds the evil supercomputer in that is waaaaay more diverse than I’ve ever seen in the “tech” world of today.  The core development team in that involves multiple black people, and a number of women.  I’m pretty sure I’ve literally never seen a black person at that “tech” incubator I go past daily.  So after 45 years of supposed social progress, we end up with many times less diverse group of people than in distopian sci fi from the late 60s.  Now, I do see women over there periodically, but there are two things to notice about this.  First of all they are *never* in the outside smoking cool kid circles I see. Never. Not once.  And secondly they’re almost comically attractive.  They look much closer to the porn star ideal of the “hot young white woman” pushed by the media than, well, actual porn stars.  You can work out some calculations about the probability that the women with the best aptitude for building software products also happen to look like they’re auditioning for a SoCal porn and that probability will be astronomical.  Or it might make sense that a personality quirk of some coders is to dress up all fancy and hot for the lolz sometimes, but every day, when you’re going to work on a technology project?  Nope.  It makes no sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unless of course none of what they do has anything to do with technology or even business in the real sense of making money from goods and services and is in fact just a tribe that has formed around their ability to manipulate society into giving them money and power.  If you look at it that way, everything you see over there makes sense.  What a shitty way to live your life!!  And how sad that as a society we let them get away with it.  Fuck these people.  Seriously.\n"

    "# Anarchist Industrial Development(title?)\n",
    "\n",
    "Anarchist technology is always free.  It is owned by no one.  Not only is there no intellectual property, there is no physical property, except for the Trash Wizard stick, which might effectively be a part of a Trash Wizards person.  The act of creation of an anarchist artifact is a gift to society of that artifact.  A trash wizard might grab any technology lying around and re purpose it at any time.  Anarchist technology does not recognize the concept of assigning value to things numerically in any way.  Anarchist technology may get involved in various value circles, having various thypes of abstract relationships with various value circles, as codified in the Data Feed.  Anarchist technology is also energy free in the sense that it always uses ambient energy, be it a set of pedals, a hand crank, a wind turbine, a steam turbine, a tidal generator, a lightning accumulator, or a solar concentrator.  Anarchist technology is designed to be as modular as possible, being as friendly with other unrelated technlogy as possible.  Anarchist technology does not distinguish between information, energy, and materials--all three are processed as equal participants in the various flow through the system.  Technlogy is not to be considered free unless it can be constructed by a small band of trash wizards using their trash wizard sticks using common source materials from the waste stream of the old extractionist economy.  The ideology of trash wizardry is that capitalist industry sacrificed itself for the bounty of our new free world.  Mining is dangerous and destructive and suicidal, but it's done, and we thank our ancestors, thank their sacrafice and their hard work and the creation of so much material wealth so evenly distributed(you can find a mineral from anywhere pretty much everywhere thanks to the spread of capitalist industrial technology).  We give thanks for this great gift from our ancestors and build a society based on free living on the bones of the old world. We accept that things will never go back to how they were before industrial capitalism but that we can live better becasuse of our mineral inheritance.  We accept that the ways of the old world were a suicide pact, but also that even in a more free world, we can never be free from change and uncertainty.  Ways of life, empires, whole worlds, climates, continents, will rise and fall, and we cannot stop that level of cataclysmic change from happening.  But we can build an adaptable and sustainable future based on free values that moves forward into a future actually worth seeing.  We can bring adventure back into the human condition, as well as acceptance of a huge and uncertain world, and our role as passengers on it.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Anarchist technology also breaks barriers between customer, worker, engineer.  We eliminate these heirarchical notions.  We are people. We build things as needed and help each other as needed.  We tell stories to express our values with the help of our Data Feed.  We break the very idea of an economy open and build a new way of relating to each other and existing.  \n",

    "# All Federal R&D Must be Open \n",
    "\n",
    "If the taxpayer of a nation is going to spend money on research, there are really only two possibilities: either the work goes into the public domain, or a private company is stealing money from the public.  As of now the latter is almost always the case.  This will some day be viewed as what it is: outright theft.  No one has the right to make a private profit from knowledge the public paid for.  Ever.  As I’ve said over and over, the problem with drug profiteers like the hedge fund guy everyone loves to hate is not what the price is, it’s that they are in the position to set a price at all.  The whole system is evil.\n",
    "\n",
    "Federal agencies in the US are now finally starting to at least push grantees to publish their work in open access journals.  This is a start, and the feds also reserve the right to use patents without royalties if they use it themselves, but this is a red herring.  The feds mostly don’t actually build things.  They pay companies to build things, who are then allowed to demand payment from each other(all of which comes from the taxpayer, who has now paid many times over) for the ideas the public paid to create.  If the US government is to keep existing and to keep funding R&D it is time for the following reforms:\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tcomplete elimination of the patent system\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tfull-open-data policy, where all data as it’s found is pushed out to the data sphere for consumption by the whole world.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s it, really.  It’s simple. When I close my eyes and try to imagine how different our R&D culture is, I just can’t believe this is not on anyones agenda.  Without patents or secrets and with full real time data disclosure we could all work a hell of a lot faster and more creatively.  The constant need to be create stuff that can get into flashy publications as well as to patent new technologies that can create fundamentally new industries which increase shareholder value distorts everything we do in applied physics R&D.  It comes back to the slime-zistor.  If I were to develop that in the normal way, it would not be new enough or fancy enough to get funded or build a VC funded company on or get the flashy papers that get those pumps primed, so it could never happen.  But if I want to create tons of great data for the dataverse that people can find useful to get me hooked into lots of big value circles, something based on some ubiquitous slime is perfect.  Because the more common the slime that has the desired electrical effects, the more useful that knowledge will be to the largest possible number of people.\n",
    "\n",
    "Free everything.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the very least, it seems that the Federal Government needs to implement policies that make it easy and create incentives for grantees in the private sector to opt out of all patents and provide full public access.  Just as there are set asides for a variety of disadvantaged small business for federal funding there should be monetary incentives built into that process which allow companies in the current system to benefit financially from the choice to go 100% open.\n",
    "\n",
    "There might be value to a sticker that says “no patents” or something much more explicit like “TrulyFree Hardware” which would be a certification that indicates that the company has taken certain measures to make sure the product is fully in the public domain and is as free as possible.  Could for profit companies charge a premium on that sticker and use that for an R&D budget?  Perhaps.  This would allow for customer-funded R&D, which is different from crowd funding in that the customer is not paying for R&D and the product together for a new product but rather paying today for the R&D to create the product of tomorrow.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think it is looking more and more like lafelabs.org should have a store where the various parts that need to be made with federal reserve dollars and  a global supply chain can be bought and sold.  This should all be open and free.\n"

    "# Deconstructing \"Capitalism\"\n",
    "\n",
    "What is capitalism?  This is something that critics of it weirdly avoid a lot of the time.  If you look up various definitions, it generally goes something like this: Capitalism is the economic system in which the means of production are privately owned.\"  I hate this definition.  \n",
    "\n",
    "What this definition implies is that the opposite of capitalism is someone other than \"the private owners\" or \"the capitalists\" owning the \"means of production\", and \"economics\" being based on something other than private capital.  I put all these things in scare quotes becuase I see them all as subtle weapons to inject hidden ideology into poeoples minds by the very wording of the definition.  First of all, the anarchist rejection of capitalism rejects ownership of minerals, land, and machines.  So any defintion that talks about \"who owns what\" should already be rejected by the anarchist, and we have already ceded a major point by allowing this definition to stand at all unexamined. Capitalism is a system in which some people, called \"owners\", claim to have power over certain things which they claim the right to carry out by force if needed.  Capitalism is a system in which a military state exists which both feeds of the system of privately owned extraction and enforces the power strucutre that governs it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The \"means of production\" is also a problematic phrase.  While it is a bit ambiguous, I see this phrase as at least potentially implieing that this the \"means\" is some sort of fixed infrastrcture.  The implication is that \"the means of production\" is a thing that exists outside of economic systems, which can be controlled by any of various types of government or state.  This is total bullshit.  The very structure of \"production\" in today's society is what I would call capitalism. The Soviet system, the various Fascist systems, \"democracies\", dictatorships, monarchies, I would say every single one of them is capitalist.  They all have this basic structure of military power creating a monopoly of force that protects a vast system to extract mineral wealth and destroy it as fast as possible by constant threat of violence.  To me calls to \"seize the means of production\" sound like calls against a king to go seize the palace and tell the king what to do but to keep the palace and king in place.  It's the same system, with slight changes.  So to let the capitalists define these ideas gives them a victory before a debate even begins: it allows that the existing \"means of production\" should continue to exist.  A true challenge to capitalism is one in which the very concept of production is reinvented.  It means building industrial technology from the ground up around different values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another problem with the notion of \"economic system\".  I would argue that economics is again a part of the intellectual descendent of the basic idea of the One God of monotheists.  There is a Uniersal Heirerarchy that exists, which allows numbers to be used to asign value to things.  Human value becomes a number, always either less than or greater than or equal to any other numerical human value.  Part of rejecting the basic ideas of capitalism is to reject this heirerarchy cast down from God.  But to even use the phrase \"economic system\" again lets capitalism be defined in a universe in which nothing other than capitalism exists. \n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed in some of the definitions I've found online they even add phrases like \"as opposed to State ownership of the means of production\".  In other words the supposed definition of capitalism used by most people is not a definition of capitalism at all, but a clever propaganda piece that creates a world in which the alternative to capitalism is another type of capitalism which is re-cast as the Socialist Enemy.  Since I consider all the Soviet style \"communist\" countries to be capitalist in their philosophical worldview, I find it not surprising that they hold the same warped view of this false dichotomy.  The communists can point to \"capitalism\" as their enemy, where \"the ruling class\" \"own\" the \"means of production\", rather than \"the dictatorship of the proletariat\".  When this goes to shit like it always does and destroys the environment even worse than \"capitalism\", people on the right say \"I told you so\" and people on the left say \"it will be different next time! it's all Stalin's fault!\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "So if we really want to move beyond capitalism, criticisms of it need to start trying to really see it for what it is, and see just how far the viral ideas about God that underly it have wormed their ways into the very language we use to describe it.  "

    "Suppose I have a motor I have built, and you have need for a motor.  Suppose I have built 1000 motors so I can easily spare a couple for your robot.  You need a robot, I can give you a robot, so of course I give you a robot.  Together, we have created value in the world in this transaction because you having a robot and me having 999 robots is much more useful than me having 1000 robots and you having zero robots.  MUCH more!\n",
    "\n",
    "Right now we have two choices: we can just call it a gift, hand you the robot, and I can feel like a nice guy.  Or I can demand some “money” for it, after which we say I “sold” the robot to you.  I put scare quotes around these words, as I often do, to denote that I’m about to reject the assumptions of these terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "When people say “money” they mean debt from the Federal reserve bank, or some other central bank.  That debt has value because it is backed by the military might of the United States, which accepts that debt in its collection of taxes.  But this is fucked.  Why should we need debt from some military backed bank in order to do this clearly positive transaction? Surely just doing this adds value to society and we should be able to denote that without federal reserve debt.  But there is not necessarily any motivation for anyone to make that possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what is the alternative?  It seems that the most common alternative is the Marx-influenced concept of the time dollar.  A local currency can be created based on hours of labor which can be exchanged through a community without any government involvement, taxes, or any banks.  But that is of no help for our robot transaction.  My robots were built by robots and took no labor.  When you get the robot, it will do labor so you don’t have to.  By carrying out a transaction that saves labor, we’re decreasing the value available in the system according to Marxian labor theory of value.  Anything that makes life easier creates deflation in a  labor based currency, which users of federal reserve debt can attest to the horror of.\n",
    "\n",
    "I propose that a usable way to communicate value outside of bank debt will involve the ability of people carrying out a transaction to simply create a marker of the value they mutually created.  I also propose that fancy math will not be the basis of this.  Especially fancy math backed by faith in libertarian neck beard fucks(you know what currency I’m talking about). It will be based on trust.  Trust of the people involved in the transaction, which moves like a bubble through the untrusted mass of society.\n",
    "\n",
    "I propose that one way to do this is for a transaction to be a chapter in a story, and that that story caries the value.  So it works like this: I give you a robot.  We write a very short story about this, why we did it why it was a good idea, why the robot is cool, etc.  Short, to the point, with some details.  Now, I can take this story down to the coffee shop and say “hey, man, can I have some coffee, I gave someone a robot today!” They say “yeah, you can have coffee here for the next week or so for a robot, sure.  That’s the next chapter of the story.  They pass that along to their milk supplier, who adds another chapter and sends it to the fence post company, who takes the longer story to an affiliate coop out in the country who is part of our network, who delivers a much more substantial wood processing robot machine.

    "# More on Value Circles \n",
    "\n",
    "Another element of the value circle currency concepts is myths.  Myths, legends, narratives, call it what you want.  One way to create shared trust between members of a value circle is to have shared culture, or folklore.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do people believe these to be actually true?  Maybe.  Maybe it doesn’t matter.  My view is that existing money already has a weird religious belief built in of the most dangerous possible kind: that which people don’t even acknowledge IS a belief.  The entire world view created by the monetary system where everyone has to exchange central bank debt is not related to physical, social, or biological reality.  It’s a artificial creation which harms most of the people who without having a choice or even understanding that they made the choice are forced to live their lives by it.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to combat what is essentially a very conservative religion is to form a belief system outside it, making the transition from the money belief system to a new one more explicit than just “losing faith” in money which does not force the concept of money to be treated as a religion.\n",
    "\n",
    "What would be an example?  I think initially they would tend to fall into two categories: fan fiction and religion.  One of the easiest ways to build a mythology of a value circle is to do something like base things off of Star Wars or Supernatural or something.  It helps when people know a thing well enough to have a shared reference easily right from the start.  For people who already have some sort of religion, building a trust network based on that both formally and informally is an obvious way to get started.  Of course other values would be shared by a value circle, including technically specific elements like “meters of 24 AWG copper magnet wire”, but on top of the specific parts, I believe having something less quantitative and more personal is useful.

    "# On Money and Additive Value \n",
    "\n",
    "I hate money, and also love it, and that is typical of people in our civilization.  I’ve thought a lot about all that over the last year of my total personal disillusionment with capitalism.  I’m definitely against most of how our “economy” works, and definitely in favor of something else, but it’s hard to even know where to start with all that.\n",
    "\n",
    "One habit I’ve acquired over the last few months of reading and thinking about anti-capitalism is replacing the word “money” in my mind with “federal reserve debt”.  That’s literally what it is, and constantly reminding myself of that helps me to think clearly about the world around me and what to do about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing that I hate about money that I want to raise here is that it is dissipative.  When a transaction occurs, one party transfers their federal reserve debt to another in exchange for some more real good or service.  That transfer has all kinds of losses in it.  First of all, in the money system the most value that can possibly exist after the transaction is the amount you started with.  Until another party is brought in, in a single transaction,  the amount of federal reserve debt always goes down, just as the amount of entropy always goes up in chemistry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at a system like this it’s clear that the best way to accumulate federal reserve debt is to be the dissipation.  One way to do this is literally to take something from the transaction, which is what paypal and banks and credit cards and the rest of the finance industry do.  Another is to make money off taxes, as the military industrial complex does. And a third  is to be a middle man in the information channel from seller to buyer, by being in the advertising/marketing industry.  And indeed I argue that these three types of accumulation are the main power lines in our society: military, finance and marketing.  Plenty of power and wealth accumulators are all three or some combination, but I argue that most power in our society is based on these three pillars because they are the optimal means to accumulate federal reserve debt.  Everything else loses to these dissipations and eventually feeds someone in one of these three pillars more than your little project possibly ever can accumulate.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not so much my goal here to attack the concept of central bank debt, taxes, etc. as to think about how to get outside this to add and exchange value without that system.  What I argue is that a transaction should add a note of value to both sides, not just one, and that it should require no value on a balance sheet before the transaction. This second part is extremely critical. One of the crippling problems of our current system is that it prevents anyone from being self sufficient, ever.  If some group wants to exchange goods and services in a closed economy they need to first get federal reserve debt from the outside in order to even have units of currency with which to work.  Add dissipation to that, and eventually they’ll always be more and more dependent over time on the outside world, and be forced to participate in global capitalism.  A system that addresses these problems must allow parties to agree to do a thing, do it, and create from nothing the value that can be further passed along to the rest of society.   Another critical flaw in the money system is the negative value of work.  We assume that in any work transaction there is a winner and a loser. E.g. at a gym everyone has to either pay or get paid, it’s assumed that the coaches are losing something and the athletes are gaining, so they are on opposite sides of a neutral or net-negative(with rent and taxes etc) transaction.  But surely the coaches also gain?  Are they not also athletes?  And the athletes are working just as hard, why is their work somehow “opposite”?\n",
    "\n",
    "All this is cleared up by the additive currency concept.  Here a transaction creates a value pair, with half taken by each party.  Thus when a personal trainer meets with an athlete, they each walk away with a unit of value equal to one times the value of that transaction.  Let’s now go back to my motor factory supply chain.  An urban scavenger rolls up on their bike with a big bin of copper wire, and we each record that that was of value and changed hands.  They then take that value token to the local coffee shop who pours them coffee and both sides get the coffee transaction token.  The coffee shop buys a coffee grinding machine using one of our motors from one of our customer factories, more tokens are generated on both sides. The coffee shop takes this new hoard of tokens and pays their workers, and this payment also generates value on both sides, further accumulating the wealth of the coffee shop who is a major pillar in all this.   The grinder factory trades with us for motors in bulk, and some bulk material transaction value is again created on both sides of the sheet.\n",

    "There is a strong analogy between this system and the so-called h-index used in academia.  The h index is designed to create a measure of the success of an academic career based on the combination of two factors: how many times has someone published and how much are those publications cited. The idea is to avoid valuing either the one paper that gets 1000 citations or the author who publishes 100 papers a year none of which are ever read.  Authors who both publish often and get frequently cited are, on average, going to be the biggest contributors to value in the field.  For better or worse, h-index ends up having real value that can get turned into federal reserve debt by having an impact on hiring and promotions of academics.    It’s not a perfect system by any means and is widely abused by departments but I think it’s an interesting proof of principle that this idea can be useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "A missing part of all this is a proposed implementation strategy.  How should the value be accounted for?  I could think of a lot of ways to do it but I want to make the point that I think this is much less important and difficult than a lot of techno nerds want you to believe. Any store of value, whether it’s paypal, cash, or credit card debt is basically based on trust.  Sure, there are anti-counterfeiting measures on bills and encryption on online transactions.  But for the most part these systems work because most people can be trusted most of the time.  If everyone really were out to steal and cheat, encryption would be nowhere near enough to save it, and it would collapse instantly.  All this works because the VAST majority of people would rather do something useful than go into the illegal bill printing business or credit card theft.  One way I think it could be done is with an archive of stories.  Some kind of shared electronic narrative that includes all the transactions in the network.  This is not great for doing illegal shit or avoiding government surveillance, and that is a problem in some ways.  But not in the long run because it forces people to push back against the government controls a lot harder and faster and also because that stuff can always still happen with federal reserve debt, alternate and more anonymous systems, etc.  Clearly there will be others for whom this doesn’t work.  But I believe that a story-database-based system of value can work for some people.  And if it works for *anyone* it’s instantly extremely powerful because it will grow exponentially and naturally find the people who can benefit from it most.  Is it taxable?  Probably not.  If we do things “for free” meaning no federal reserve debt is exchanged at all, what is there to tax?  Surely not vast, unencrypted databases of anecdotes and poems describing the actions of millions of people.\n",
    "\n",
    "And it’s not even really necessarily a threat to the government tax system, I think. Part of how our system is as broken as it is is how differently it serves those who control  the pillars of power from the rest of us.  The fact is that the capitalist overlords, governments, military machines etc.  don’t really need the vast majority of us to exist.  Our demands for food, medical care, housing etc. are mostly an inconvenience to them.  An economy like this might take what looks like potential tax revenue out of the system, but it also takes an incredibly vast load of social welfare spending off of the existing system, since that kind of value is so much better created in the additive value system.\n",

    "One more point is that I don’t consider bitcoin to be in any way relevant to fixing the money system.  With any form of currency, you have to ask “who do I trust when I place trust in this?”  I have lots of criticisms of the central banks, and the federal reserve in particular.  But given the choice between central bankers and some neck beard fedora software montherfuckers, I’ll take the central bankers any day of the week.  Because the demographic in charge of bitcoin is, in my view, the single least trustworthy group that exists in our society.  Also, building deflation into a currency is so bizarrely pathological it’s not even worth looking at.  Bitcoin isn’t money, neck beards are not revolutionaries, it’s time to move on.\n",
    "\n",
    "So where do we start?  I think I want to build a supply chain out of trash, and then just try the database of stories method and see what happens.  Having a supply chain that is clearly of value will give me the leverage to start a thing like this. So probably another year or two are required, and hopefully by then I’ll be more comfortable with python and will be able to build a prototype software system to start this off.\n"

    "\n",
    "1. suffering\n",
    "\n",
    "2. and minerals\n",
    "\n",
    "Turning minerals and human misery into numbers is capitalism in a nutshell.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Capitalism is an industrial system in which all value is based on human misery and minerals.  By creating misery, some people use threats of violence to control land.  They use more minerals, fire, and misery to create minerals ordered with a precision based on their belief in violence and control through military order.  The threat of inflicting misery using military techology(not only is our technology military, our concept of military is based on our technology as well, and both are based on the One God beliefs)  is how some people known as capitalists claim \"ownership\".  Ownership is a complex network of violent threats which allow threats of future misery and benefits paid from past misery to be added up numerically, building a ladder of power down which the physical benefits of mineral wealth slowly trickel, with the most landing at the top.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Any proposal to reform capitalism that maintains concept of numerical adding up of suffering and minerals is just capitalism with a new mask on.  True reform means finding a set of moral values that informs technological figures of merit which are based on human joy, adventure, hilariousness, beauty, or other things that actually have positive value for everyone, and then re-builds our whole concept of what it means to have a technology up from scratch.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To repeat: to attempt to reform capitalism while continuing to use any of our current technology at all is a lost cause.  The ideas of capitalism are built into the position of every atom in a modern technical artifact.  If you want a world without capitalism you must re order every atom, completely re design how atoms go together from the bottom up.  And it only makes sense to have this system acknowledge that this does not exist in a vacuum: 300-400 years of capitalism gave us the gift of minerals, which we can now live on forever.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Every atom.  Every atom changes in how it relates to the whole.  Same physics, same atoms, but new ordering principles, breaking out of the military design concepts.  No more are the ideal shapes always planes, circles, and perfect grid arrays of objects. No more are tech artifacts locked into a centrally controlling clock that tells them when to work and what to do.  No more is there a wall between engineer and customer, where some things are known and some are secret: all information on construction is physically encoded in the artifact, and updated as more edits are made, even if the user does not document(data stream into the dataverse)."

    "# Coil Winding Machines \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the first machines we need to build in the Project is the coil winding machine.  There will need to be many versions of this, as both size and number of units scale both up and down.\n",
    "What will the first coil winding machine look like?  It should have a working directional bias, in the sense that unlike many of the motors I’ve built it must only push one direction, and reverse the direction if it starts wrong.\n",
    "I think a typical motor of the sort used for this will be 250 turns per coil, with 4 coils, or 1000 turns to make it even.  I want not more than about 3 minutes to be the time to make that motor.  So that’s about 300 RPM(revolutions per minute).  Divide 300 by 60 and we get 5 turns per second.  Suppose we want to be able to pull 1 pound of force out at 2 cm of radius from the center.  The speed at radius r is r*2*pi*f.  Google lets you put in mixed units like this so putting in “1 pound force*5 Hz*2*pi*2 cm” gives about three watts.  So I want a motor that can do about 3 W of actual work.  So for 1.5 A and 5 V circuits this should be possible.\n",
    "A motor with a +/- X and +/- Y pair of coils and a large magnet of the proper shape should do this easily.  Each pair of coils should sum to the resistance of about right to get an amp and a half. I imagine, as above, each coil about 250 turns, with 4 coils total, making two connected pairs, which can be driven by a single board, the version 6 of the coil control boards.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also want a turn counter that is intuitive, with a nice display and reset.  Also there should be a tool to measure wire gauge. And also a simple way to test for insulation failures.  There also must be a system for easily mounting various types of wire source, based on typical coil configurations in sources like transformers, alternates, fan motors, etc.  A mechanism needs to be invented to automate the process of setting the holder wires below the coil, then wrapping them up and around the torus after it’s done spinning, and pulling the finished coil off, then coating the whole thing in some protective insulator.  When all these things are automated, a single cell of the machine should be producing a fully finished set of 4 coils every 4 minutes or so.  So a machine with N cells might be making a finished motor every 1/N of that.  For 100 units, which seems feasible in a squat-factory pretty easily–producing 1500 in an hour!  Clearly the limits to scale there quickly become finding feedstock fast enough, and how quickly that feedstock can be put into the automation system.\n",
    "\n",
    "That choke point in the process leads to the task after making the coil winder: finding a mass-efficient way to get the right kind of junk and breaking it down.  For the first, what is needed is to build up an economy that engages more humans to help forage the country side for the parts.  For the second, this might well be the first of the robot rumbles: destructor robots.  A destructor robot at its simplest is just a cutting tool that uses Philosophy Engine motors to drive the cutters.  At its most complex, it references all found parts to a giant database of capitalist products, figures out where useful stuff is, prioritizes what to go after, selects tools, and uses them to break down source artifacts into higher quality feedstock.\n",
    "\n",
    "One can imagine this working on a medium scale very easily.  Imagine a crew of up to a couple dozen local people are trained in a focused hunt on top of their existing scavenging(scrapers and dumpster divers).  They bring in wheelbarrow loads of, for example, alternators and fan motors.  A person with various bionic extensions in the form of “prosthetic” limbs with cutting tools, able to run many tools at once with limited automation, is in a intake bay ripping through things and sorting them, and putting them into standardized pre-coil-pods.  These can then get passed to someone else in the Value Circle economy outside the factory if someone wants to.  Or they get passed over to the spinner room where many coil winders can run at a time, making coils.  These coils have a spime type aspect where all the data of each coil is in/on the coil in a way that references back to an open database.  So again, this becomes a commodity that can get passed along to more global value circles if someone wants to.   An assembly robot is then just a set of motors that move everything into place to go from coils to a full motor(at least the stator part).\n",
    "Note that I forgot about the magnets and bearings.  Both of those can also come from car and computer parts.  Probably the simplest thing to do is a design based on a Samarium Cobalt magnet in a hard drive, then just give specs on desired drives.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far what I’ve described has a lot of missing pieces.  One of the largest is the same problem mining always has: what to do with the leftover material after the part you want comes out?  In the short term this has to mean having the materials get re-absorbed into the scavenger ecosystem.  I.e. if someone wants to drop off some raw alternators they need to pick up some alternator skins to return to wherever the rest of their junk goes.  Ideally the research lab lives at this point of the supply chain circle: a major ongoing topic of research in the tribe will be studying how to make another part of the automation infrastructure with standardized parts that are shed by the main process.\n",
    "And eventually the scavenging process will be more based on controlling whole rumbles of robots so that that is more fun and less work and more productive.  One type of robot might soar like a hawk on thermal drafts, scouting for miles around for areas to concentrate on, with large rumbles able to cover potentially unlimited area.  Another type might get flushed down toilets, look for stuff in the sewer, then climb out and crawl home with various molecular treasures.  Another robot will produce a huge number of itself and spend 200,000 years crawling across a plutonium sacrifice zone separating the various metals and collecting them for future use at the end of the radioactive decay.  The goal to use human feedback, good user interface design etc. to make it possible with very limited automation to have small group of people control a very large set of large rumbles of robots.\n",
    "\n",
    "All that’s getting a bit ahead, however. First I have to make ONE coil winding machine, and make ONE more just like it out of an alternator from a junk yard and a couple magnets from old hard drives, then complete the loop.  Then the robot revolution can start to scale.  But it all starts with that one self-reproducing(with a little help) coil.\n",
    "It looks like the VERY next step is to upgrade the control boards to the version 6 design that allows for both plus and minus current through either coil, and replaces the two DIP socket op amps with a single dual channel SMT op amp chip.  Once I have these, and have made them in house, I can optimize the motor that winds the coils, make a jig with sticks and wires to automate the process, then self reproduce with clean wire off eBay first.  And then probably buy a couple more ebay things to test first before going for the full supply chain.  With that motor in hand it makes sense to build all the demos, create a show out of them, make a simple capacitive storage system, a simple tablet robotic control with the Pi, and then write the book and look for funding.\n",

Then there are you tube people who make a living doing really dangerous things with electricity.  And professional trolls who somehow get food and shelter from strangers all over the internet in support of their asshole online persona.  I don’t want to be any of these specifically. I don’t want to sell an e-book about the end of the world, be an asshole for money, or court death with high voltage youtube experiments.\n",

But one thing I realized was that there was a whole world of pairs of guys who drive around.

    "# 3 Forms of Motion \n",
    "\n",
    "The motor has three main types of motion I want to target: linear oscillation, rotation, and circular oscillation.  Linear oscillation is the simplest, and I already have that working great.  Rotation is what I’ve been mostly working on recently, and I hope to make a lot of progress on that this week. The third motion, which I’m calling circular oscillation, is the most unusual.  The idea is to have a  oscillator with two degrees of freedom(both of the other forms of motion have one), and to drive both with a preferred direction, clockwise or counter-clockwise.\n",
    "Suppose I have two harmonic oscillators, one driven with sine(blue) and one with cosine(green).  Those are graphed here vs. time for an angular frequency of 1 rad/s:\n",

    "A circle!

In this case it might be two oscillators right next to each other with identical resonant frequencies, which change the volume of adjacent chambers in a fluid system.  by changing the sign of the angular frequency and driving one at resonance with feedback and the other at a pi/2 phase shift, it should be possible to make a reversible pump with no bearings or blades or valves!  I want that for so many reasons!  A pump that can be easily built from found materials and has minimal moving parts and is reversible could be used for:\n",

If a set of spring loaded legs on a robot are bounced in a circular motion with some CW or CCW orientation it should be possible to have a robot hop with a controlled direction and very fast and smooth resonant hopping motion.  I’m pretty sure most animals that have a good hop like Kangaroos and rabbits have something like this going on, and store a bunch of potential energy in the springy leg of the animal.  With some auto balancing I think it should be possible to make a one legged hopping robot.  I also think this technology will be relevant for the propulsion of the ball robot: by shaking with the right orientation I think it should be possible to control the rolling and leaping very fast with fast feedback.  That can also be used for various other linear drives that are not for propulsion as such, moving various linear things around for manufacturing for example.\n",

I have no idea if that can work, but what if it does?! It would be an awesome way to make fast sewer robots that can dive into tunnels and do things.  Maybe that is a horrible idea.

So I want to talk about rumbles of robots.  In particular the difference between robots used for consumption and for production.\n",

The main initial figure of merit in the growth of their network will be coverage: the more potential consumers are covered, the better.

    "# Against Gears \n",
    "\n",
    "Today I’m going to rant about gears: I’m against them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gear is one of the first and most common symbols we see of engineering and technology.  It’s used commonly as a generic logo by every kind of engineer and is generally seen as a point of pride by engineers.  I, like others with a lot of time in advanced technical education, have felt the swell of pride on seeing a nicely drawn logo with a gear on it for some school or project that I’m involved in.  It makes me feel  powerful, and like I’m part of something great.\n",
    "\n",
    "And indeed gears are great!  What they can do is absolutely fascinating to study, mesmerizing to watch, and useful in just about every industry.  One of my many favorite exhibits at the Exploratorium in San Francisco is one where a motor turns a shaft at one end of a huge number of pairs of gears which decrease speed from the drive motor so that you have centuries of time for one revolution by the time you get to the last gear!  It’s amazing to see how this precise mechanical thing that appears so simple can bridge  this span of time from fractions of a second out to centuries.  And I’m again and again amazed at what gear designers can do in terms of inventing new stuff.  My grandfather was an engineer at Chrysler many decades ago, and was always at the cutting edge of calculator and computer use back in the old days to do computation for new gear designs.  That work had very real impact on the quality of car that could be built.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely the enemies of industrial society have always used the gear as a symbol of that which they seek to overthrow.  The monkey wrench is generally thought to be a wrench thrown into the gears of “the machine”, presumably not just breaking everything but making it very hard to repair.    When Mario Savio spoke for the Free Speech Movement on the steps of Sproul Hall he said this:\n",
    "\n",
    "“There’s a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious, makes you so sick at heart, that you can’t take part! You can’t even passively take part! And you’ve got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels…upon the levers, upon all the apparatus, and you’ve got to make it stop! And you’ve got to indicate to the people who run it, to the people who own it, that unless you’re free, the machine will be prevented from working at all! ”\n",
    "\n",
    "What he was talking about 100% about the operation of a university(UC Berkeley).  Universities presumably don’t actually run on giant gears.  But that metaphor still appears front and center: the thing he seeks to stop is not an office or stack of papers or some other University project, it’s GEARS.\n",
    "\n",
    "One other point I want to bring up about gears is steam punk.  I love steam punk, I think it’s really fun. I had a steam punk wedding!  But it’s important to remember what it’s all about.  At it’s heart it’s about recreating aspects of Victorian England and mixing them with the modern.  And it’s worth remembering that Victorian England is nothing to be nostalgic about.  During the rule of Queen Victoria the British Empire was one of the most ruthless wielders of global economic and military power in history.  In an empire where the sun literally never set, a small corporate elite in London(and a few other global imperial cities) exploited people throughout the globe as well as right next door in their hideous filthy shit hole of a city(literally, with actual holes filed with shit).  These are people who felt the best way to regulate the opium trade in Singapore was to auction the monopoly off to the highest bidder then protect that monopoly with force.  Not nice guys.  So is all this just a coincidence? Did human technology just happen to be all about gears in a time that just happens to have involved cool looking hats and coats which endlessly amuse nerds the world over?  Obviously I’m going to say no, because that’s my thing!\n",
    "\n",
    "I think that gears are part of a rigid, disciplined, military approach to technology.  Gears have to be damn near perfect or they won’t work.  The number of teeth must be exactly correct, perfectly regular around the gear or it won’t work at all.  A single broken tooth can often render the whole gear useless.  Small amounts of just about anything getting in the gears can cause them to instantly fail, possibly permanently.  Or slowly get worse over time until they wear out and are totally useless as anything but scrap.  Gears also often require a huge mechanical stress locally on the teeth, meaning the quality of steel used matters, again raising the bar to create the thing.  Gears are a very accessible technology for a huge military power based on extraction of resources and mass deployment of industrial labor.  They create a priest/engineer class who can design them, a working class who has to work with discipline and focus to create them, and a helpless user class who consumes them but cannot repair them ever.  Gears are a symbol of military industrial power because they can only be created by that type of power.  They also turn around and regulate that military society that built them, being an essential technology in the development of clocks through the rise of the European empires.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as space is a symbol of military might today in part because of the power vested in GPS satellites, clocks were a symbol of military might in the rise capitalist empires because you need a good clock to measure longitude on a long sea voyage.  So those gears as used in clocks translated very directly to real military and economic power which was wielded mercilessly on the whole world to bring yet more military and industrial order to the world under the British Crown(and others). Today the power of precise time is both centralized and distributed: thanks to the cell network, everyone has access to extremely high accuracy time and position data both.  And of course the role of clocks in people’s lives in capitalism is yet another example of industrial precision enforced by military force, telling people when to work, when to rest, when to eat, etc. and threatening their livelihood(“job”) if they do not obey.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, but what does it mean to turn our backs on gears?  Don’t we need them?  Well, sometimes.  But not always.  Gears let you transform the mechanical impedance of a system, that is, trade off speed for force, going from fast/weak to slow/strong or vice versa.  That is indeed very useful, but is that the only way to do it?  No.  There are many clever systems of levers, belts, pulleys, and hydraulics that can also do the same basic function.  In some cases a problem is simply way better solved with a gear than some type of belt. But did that problem really need to be solved?  I believe that it’s often necessary to reconsider which problems we really want to solve, and try to avoid the kinds of things that need gears.  One of the ways we get stuck with gears is that they’re easily to integrate into the existing motor technology.  I’ve developed products that use electric motors with gear boxes.  This technology is cost effective, rugged, and functional.  It’s also loud and very difficult to reproduce outside of a giant factory.  I’d ditch it if I could, but given current state of the art for motors that’s not an option and I’m stuck with the noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attacking the assumptions made in choosing to use gears is one of the reasons it makes sense to get down to the root of how motors are made and build it back up from nothing.  I want motors that don’t require expensive machinery to manufacture into products, and that don’t enforce rigid discipline on the design of the products they get used in.  This means they get built with the transformation of speed and torque in mind right from the start, but also with the flexibility to have that be done in many different possible ways.  For now, for me, I think that means v-belts and pulleys.  And some plain old levers for reciprocal action motors.\n",
    "\n",
    "So my revolutionary manifesto in regards to gears is this: let’s build something much better, and then no one has to monkey wrench any gears–they’ll all fail on their own without anyone’s help!\n"

    "\n",
    "I think all private property is immoral.  But intellectual “property” is the most blatant form of theft a person can carry out against their fellow people.\n",
    "\n",
    "I’m sick and tired of hearing people use creators, especially inventors, as the excuse for the existence of the IP(intellectual property) system.  The vast majority of the time for the vast majority of creators, be they writers, artists, musicians, inventors, engineers, or scientists, the IP system primarily exists to protect the “rights” of our employers.  As with so many arguments in defense of capitalism, we find people howling with rage about their “right” to some minuscule slice of a pie totally controlled by the forces of capital.  As long as a creative person gets their 1 penny on the dollar or whatever, they’re happy to defend their bosses’ rights to the other 99 cents.\n",
    "\n",
    "So first of all I believe the defenses of the system are bullshit.  I think we have a system that *usually* screws the creators, as in the VAST majority of the time the VAST majority of creators see nothing for their work, while their work generates huge wealth for the controllers of capital.\n",
    "\n",
    "But even if it did provide some good to someone besides what are effectively lottery winners, the evil is overwhelming and is getting worse fast.  Technology is getting even more personal, and even more wrapped up in our daily lives. The smart phone makes technology involved in our personal lives in ways never before possible.  We now live in a regime where various capitalists claim to actually own certain things you can or cannot do.  Notice I don’t say “do online” or “do with your phone” because the line between “do” and “do with your phone” is being erased by the ubiquity of this technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s put aside shitty .coms suing each other over web design and music piracy and think just a little bit into the future.  Suppose wearables start to have more impact on health applications like drug delivery.  Further suppose to make it maximally personal that birth control is one of the types of medicine that gets integrated into this “tech” nightmare.  I can guarantee that in the current capitalist tech regime this will be patented.  Who will own the patent?  What if they restrict when it can be used?  What if you have to pay extra to not  see an ad every time you have sex?  What if the government has back doors to turn it off?  I should not have to go into much detail here to communicate what a nightmare this is.\n",
    "\n",
    "But it’s important to note that this is EXACTLY where we’re heading.  If someone developed that technology tomorrow, the natural way for it to be is exactly like that.  Notice the pathetic cries of fake outrage over the high cost of some drug that some hedge fund guy recently jacked up.  Watching liberal defenders of capitalism whine about that was just bizarre.  When you support patents, this is what you support.  Either you can OWN an idea or you can’t.  If you can this is what happens. If you support ownership of ideas you support this, period.  If you support capitalism you support this.\n",
    "\n",
    "The patent system cannot be “reformed” and it is counterproductive to even try.  The patent system is part of a legal framework that exists for nation states to use force to strengthen the power of capital over people.  The USPTO, like Apple, Facebook, and most of the US government simply should not exist. Money and patents need to be eliminated and replaced by a non capitalist technology.  The path we walk with the tyranny of capital over technology is going to get a lot worse before it gets better.  And by the time people start to see how bad it’s getting it will be clear that reform is not an option.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I believe that energy spent trying to reform the patent system is a waste.  Our energy instead needs to be focused on building post capitalist technology outside that whole system of control.  When the our technology works and is attractive, the capitalist institutions may well attack us.  But if we build things they need and they find that their capitalist structures need our technology just as badly as everyone else, this may turn out not to be the case.  I think that if we focus on positive building of technology instead of combat against existing technology, that we may find no such combat ever needs to happen.  For now, though, I think it’s clear that we are better off building than fighting.  Because if it’s a fight against capitalism that is planned history tells us that fight is always lost.  Capital is just too good at what it does.\n"

    "All the physics I learned in school is crap.  Calculations.  Concepts, abstractions. Essentially applied math. And why?  Well probably many reasons, but in the end we don’t get the means of production and who cares the reason.  It’s bullshit.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the means of production?  Applying and measuring voltage, current, force, velocity.  Storing physical quantities and moving them around.  Imaging.  Making atomic beams and directing them around.\n",
    "\n",
    "All this supposedly needs lots of fancy equipment, but todays equipment with a few decades ago physics is readily available for next to nothing, or really nothing for the really free technology of the trash wizard stick.\n",
    "\n",
    "I look back now on what I learned in undergrad especially with scorn.  Lab was totally separate from theory and also separate from the world around us.  I want to not just do lab experiments, but to interact with the world!  I want to look at ordinary household objects with a tiny electron microscope!  I want to make simple ion beams from materials you can find in a junk heap. I want to make high voltage circuits that do interesting things with high voltages generated mechanically with oscillators made from sticks and rocks.  I want to *measure* the ideal gas law before learning about kinetic theory! I’m not saying I don’t want to know kinetic theory. But what I am saying is that this is all backwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of starting with math, then kinetic theory, then applications then working with exotic UHV systems with expensive turbo molecular pump.  And as an aside, you learn to deal with rough pumps.  That’s just a chore along the way to feeding the Great Machine that we’re all supposed to worship: the endlessly expanding Machine that represents the capitalist sphere of the new and expensive.  The opposite path would start with experimenting with air at atmospheric pressure, then working with air plumbing and pumps, then learning about pressure physics through pump craft.  From there, more exotic systems are built and learned about. Along the way, the student is constantly recording and displaying data, learning how to analyze it along the way.  So the analytic techniques you learn in school now would still be taught–just not as some isolated sterile applied math subject.  Rather, they’re a tool that the student caries with them as they survey the real world they live in.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference is one of training methods, but it has implications for how the student drills even on the theory side.  Right now classes are structured not around the central problems of each subject(like the SHO for quantum mechanics and classical mechanics), but rather around learning how to as broadly as possible apply those to weird special cases.  But this is not how our lives work.  In life, we mostly deal with those problems–that’s why they’re so damn canonical.  Rather than learning 15 different obscure tricks for calculating electric field analytically from complicated and unrealistic shapes, a student learns to get as quickly as possible to something that is really useful, which is more likely to be approximating correctly to the right canonical case.  As for special cases, the tricks the student should be accumulating are on the practical side.  Once you learn about how to solve the quantum mechanical simple harmonic oscillator you don’t work dozens of problems doing much harder theoretical versions.  Instead you work to find more systems that behave that way around you.  You find quantum objects in your trash wizard stick lab that are described by the SHO hamiltonian, mess around with them, measure them, and graph them out in your lab notebook software.\n",
    "Then as you get more advanced still you learn to combine all that into something useful: gathering trash from your environment, analyzing its full physical composition, removing atoms and molecules as needed, creating new and useful other technology, all using your quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator.\n",
    "\n",
    "To hell with the lab.  To hell with the classroom. And to hell with companies.  The trash wizard is truly free to investigate the physical world anytime anywhere.\n"

    "# Another Demo that Must be Built: Octahedral Ball Drone \n",
    "\n",
    "The octahedral ball drone is a octahedron made of three intersecting sticks, with a flexible joint.  Each of the 6 ends has a 2 degree of freedom +/- pair of control coils and magnets with some significant amount of effective length change.  Drivers can use the natural dynamics of the flexing rods to make efficient rolling motion.  I imagine making the first one based on a LiPo battery and Raspberry Pi, with wooden sticks held with a rubber central ball that the sticks can get pushed into.  I imagine the sticks being a total of about 12 to 15 inches long total, so that each pod is about 6-8 inches from the center, and can flex by about 2-3 inches, or 20% to 50% of total.  The amount of play should be just barely more than enough to get the full sphere effect for maximally efficient rolling.  I imagine for the very first version all coils are driven by dumb feedback and it’s an art piece that rolls around in all directions chaotically until the battery dies.  Then all the boards get tied together to a central Raspberry Pi, which gets onto the net for control by a remote console.  Then the code task gets solved for the simplest possible rolling motion with directional bias.  Then some kind of simple chase algorithm is written so that it can track down a target that emits some kind of signal.  This demo could launch a whole robotics project which can be a main support column for The Project.\n"

    "One of the things I’m committing to with this blog is rambling on about physics and engineering topics about which I’m fairly ignorant.  That’s sort of my thing here.   To that end, I’m going to talk about high voltage capacitors for energy storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s why I am attracted to them: they can be found in junk heaps the world over in old TVs and monitors as well as other electronics, and they can charge up FAST.   So if you want ubiquitous energy storage over short time of the kind you’d use in the squats and communes of the future, not the kind Elon Musk builds for you, this is really ideal.  Now hold on, you say, the energy density of these things is low!  And how much energy can you really store in a 1000 uF capacitor?  Ok, sure, but energy is (1/2) C V^2, so voltage matters more than capacitance.  And if you built your mechanical energy harvester as some kind of crude high voltage generator( more on this later), you can get several kilovolts.  So, say it’s 3300 V or so, that squared is about 10 million, multiplied by 1/1000 of a Farad(say it’s 2000 uF, divide that by 2), you’ve got 10 kJ.  For comparison a AA battery with 1300 mA-h, which is what my rechargeables have at 1.5 V is 1.5V*1.3A*3600 s = about 7 kJ, so it’s comparable to a AA.  Except those AA’s I have take overnight to charge and this can charge off of some pretty random mechanical motion over just a minute or two.  Embed it in tons of silicone for safety and build simple step down circuits and you’ve got something way better to the trash wizard than any battery.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, for motor applications, I think the HV might work in some cases.  A sort of railgun style drive applied periodically could be useful for certain resonant motors.  And electrostatic motors can be useful for working with some of the micro/nano fluidics or NEMS/MEMS that go along with the vibrational engines.\n"

    "\n",
    "I’ve ranted about this on here before I think, but I’m pretty obsessed with the idea that most of our education stresses knowing many facts over mastery of the core facts way too much.  This came up in judo today as we were talking about how our BJJ school differs from some other schools.  One blue belt was talking about how when he came here he found it odd that the upper belts didn’t do anything more advanced than a blue or white belt, they just did simple stuff and were able to make it work to consistently win with it.  And we got to talking about top athletes in martial arts, and how common it is for them to have just one dominant move that they do over and over which is unstoppable.\n",
    "\n",
    "I’ll admit my feelings on this are partly driven by aesthetics as well as my own learning style, but I think that it’s almost always better to endlessly work on the core principles, possibly discarding certain cores for other ones as time goes on than to add up a larger and larger store of techniques or skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "This feeds back to my central thesis in all this for technology: that our technology has gone in very wrong directions based on bad choices.  How this philosophy of learning applies to technology is in how transparent technology is or isn’t.  Technologies I have a lot of respect for, like vice grips, bulldozers, and duct tape, can be learned by a young child easily but still take a lifetime to master the use of.  Conversely, technologies centered on computer software, the people who self identify as “the tech industry”, involve unbelievably pointless memorization of endless detailed facts which will all be obsolete in 6 months.  All this makes perfect sense if you believe, as I do, that the main purpose of “IT” is to provide secure high paying jobs for the IT cartel.  If, however, you want to build technology that people can actually master, it’s hard to imagine a much worse situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would also argue that non-free technology can never truly allow a person to become a master.  Ultimately the intellectual “property” is always owned by a corporation, answerable to shareholders, which has a legal power over the technology that no individual user can overcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "And, again, with science, I think things are all totally off the rails.  The science cartel, like the IT cartel, has a long term strategy for full employment: only study things that are “novel”, meaning they require the resources of a  large institution to access.  Our lives are filled with simple harmonic oscillators, parametric coupling, capacitors, inductors, and simple atom-light interactions.  But do we spend a lifetime in physics mastering these things?  No.  We move as fast as possible to the “forefront” of useless systems which can only be made with huge resources in order to move our professional development along as fast as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "I argue against the complex distractions that exist in ALL these systems.  Grapplers should spend a life time learning to sweep and pass guard at a high level, technologists should spend a lifetime building the perfect tool that even a child can pick up and learn, and scientists should become masters characterizing the physical world we live in.\n"

    "\n",
    "Certainly, as said yesterday, a first demo is the coil winding machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "But I think another even more basic demo is the small(about 1/4 inch diameter) cylindrical magnets on a strip of folded duct tape, which can be moved around to opposite alignments along a main axis of a drive coil.  The duct tape is meant to be floppy but not very stretchy, and can be taped to anything.  This demo is a fundamental element to both pumps and propulsion.  I could imagine this being a pushing element that goes at the tip of a rod among many radiating from a center, in a ball, that rolls.  This is the more rigid version of the tentacle ball robot.  I think it could be done with just six rods, with one drive coils per rod, so only six coils and six magnets. Accelerometers and pickup coils can combine to control the whole thing as it bounces, flops and rolls around.  These can be made for next to nothing out of trash.  They can also all be programmed to herd together, but not run on top of each other, much like sheep, and to all have a herd sense of where they want to go, again like sheep.  The Trash wizard stick then acts like a shepherds crook: a generic tool used by the trash wizard to herd(rumble) rumbles of robots.  This is important in the long run for gathering materials and many other applications, but in the short run it is great for publicity and fun/art.  Another application is moving data from one place to another, and networking.  Routers can be in all the robots, making the network of robots cover space to create huge ad hoc networks.\n",

    "\n",
    "As much as I realize “emergent” is a word that is abused by idiots, I love this concept for all its flaws.   I think that a huge danger of our reductionist way of doing science is the tendency to overlook the patterns that emerge in complex phenomena that cannot be found by looking at the parts individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is something I think about very often, but have been thinking about a lot recently in light of the book “Plutopia” by Kate Brown, which I’m still in the middle of reading.  There’s a lot of stuff in there about nuclear safety and history, accidents etc.  But the stuff that really stands out to me is the comparisons just how similar the US and USSR were in some ways in regards to the social structures the two systems created around plutonium production.  Both sides furiously studied each other, each copying the other partly out of the usual cold war paranoia of the time.  But there is, I believe, something else at work.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think part of what I’m seeing in the book is how the bad decisions of management(everything about long term biological effects and a lot of safety issues) as well as some good decisions of management(way more creature comforts than the average Soviet citizen and better public infrastructure for the average American citizen)  were created not by the systems or the people involved but by an underlying essence of plutonium production as a technology.  Certain technologies inspire certain cultural behaviors. Perhaps this is obvious.  But if that really is obviously true, it means that the choice between, say, building vast numbers of plutonium bombs or simply doing something else affects more than just whether you have the bombs or not.  It has a rippling effect to the whole rest of society that has more to do with the structure of the people around the technology than what the technology itself does.\n",
    "\n",
    "In case it’s not obvious, I am personally against all plutonium production, and indeed almost all nuclear technology.  This is partly because of my personal experience with plutonium at my old job.  To make a long story short, someone(not me!) spilled a small amount of plutonium, no one was hurt, but management behaved almost comically badly at every level throughout the process. After seeing that whole shit storm go down I’ve watched things like the Fukushima incident and read accounts like this one and what I see is that middle management in different times and places and political systems behave remarkably similarly when faced with a nuclear accident of this kind.  I believe that this means the problem is never fixable by shuffling management around, adding training and procedures etc.  It’s fixed by not doing things where they only don’t kill people if human nature is magically changed.  I know a lot of people will say some shit about how you need nuclear to generate enough energy blah blah blah.  Well, fuck off.  If your plan for the future of the human race needs that much energy and you can’t find it another way, your plan sucks.\n"

    "# First Report of my L/R Measurements \n",
    " \n",
    "This will be somewhat disjointed since I’m prioritizing writhing something now over making real documentation that someone can follow.  This is not a manual for how to do this, just a report on what I’ve done so far.\n",
    "The circuit I’ve measured is as follows:\n",
    " \n",
    "I’m modelling the inductor as a ideal zero resistance inductor in series with a resistor.  Obviously this is not totally accurate for several reasons, but it’s pretty accurate, as we’ll see, and shows the physics I want to see.  Using a transistor control board and a Arduino UNO, the voltage Vin is pulsed from zero to Vcc quasi instantaneously as the transistor is turned on.  Since the circuit is connected to Vcc initially, turning the transistor on takes the measured Vout from Vcc to a voltage that changes in time to an asymptotic value of Vcc/(R_bias + R_inductor).  I won’t go into details here as it will be in the more technical writeup, but we can solve the differential equation for this system by inspection and see that the solution is an exponential decay from the start voltage or current to the asymptotic value, with a characteristic time given by L/(R_bias + R_inductor).\n",
    "Here is a photo of the breadboard part of my setup:\n",
    " \n",
    "You can see the resistor there, it’s about 2.3 Ohms(measured on handheld DVM). The DC resistance of the coil is about 3.1 Ohms, also measured on the handheld DVM.  Power supply voltage is about 5V so in the end this thing is ramping up from zero to a current of about an amp.\n",
    "In the experiment I take a tap from between the coil and the bias resistor over to the analog input of the Arduino UNO and write a program for the UNO that turns the transistor on , records about 8 ms of data, turns it off, and waits for about another 100 ms before repeating.  I then write simple Python scripts that record and plot these data.\n",
    "A plot of a single trace of raw data is shown below:\n",
    " \n",
    "This is a 10 bit analog to digital converter, so the scale is 0 to 1023.  The voltage from ground to the top of the bias resistor is thus going from about 5V to about 3V.  OK, that’s not quite right because I drew the schematic and set up the breadboard opposite to each other: actually the bias resistor is closer to Vcc not ground, but that has no affect on what follows since I’m normalizing that out anyway.  Because I want to take the log of the exponential to get a linear function that can be easily studied, I need to first normalize by removing the offset so our exponential approaches zero:\n",
    " \n",
    "Now for simplicity I normalize so that the start value is 1.0 and everything that follows is in units of a fraction of that:\n",
    " \n",
    "And that is just a graph of the function y = exp(-t/tau), where tau is the exponential decay time.  So now we can just take the natural log of this to get log(y) = -t/tau.  To remove statistical fluctuations I took 100 averages of this experiment(which takes about 10 seconds).  The following is a plot of that log with a line fit by inspection drawn over the points:\n",
    " \n",
    "This shows that until the signal gets down to the noise floor(at about 3.5 ms), it obeys a exponential pretty well, with a decay time of about 0.54 ms.  There are visible deviations from linearity which I believe are the nonlinearity of the ADC for the UNO(they are repeatable and do not go away with averaging).   Now if the L/R time is 0.54 ms and the total resistance is about 5.4 Ohms, we get an inductance of about 3 millihenries(0.54 ms*5.4 Ohms). I believe that is reasonable for a coil of this size and number of turns.     Also a quantity worth computing is the L/R time intrinsic to the coil, without the bias resistor.  That is 3 mH/3.1 Ohm or about 1 ms.\n",
    "I think that’s the experimentally relevant number to this motor project.  1 ms is about as fast as I can expect to be turning the thing on and off, at least in terms of orders of magnitude.  Not that I want to go faster than that for any reason, but it’s useful to have that number in your head for design.\n",
    "I personally like everything about this measurement more than AC measurements of inductance for learning.  The way I learned about inductors in school was first as mysterious things that make magnetic fields for no apparent reason, then as an AC element which honestly was also pretty mysterious.  Not the equations governing it, we learned those fine, but WHY you would want one or how you would use it in a practical circuit, or anything about motors really.\n",
    "I’d like to see this combined with the RC time constant lab, and both of them studied via step functions like this rather than AC.  It’s typical in overly theoretical treatments to deal with a step function like this with Laplace transform methods but that’s really not a great idea in my opinion.  Sure, learn that if you want to learn ODE theory, but you can write down the equation of motion as well as its solution here purely by inspection and physical insight, and forcing students to understand Laplace transforms in order to understand this system is really bad, I think.\n"

I think if you are not trying to make money that this whole thing can be much simpler than the existing software and that Facebook etc can be replaced.  However, it’s also possible that the best first implementation of this will be to do it in a existing commercial system like Facebook.  This is obviously dangerous.  Dealing with companies like that can have legal problems, control problems, and limitations on what you can do practically.  It’s not ideal, but it’s something to consider.  And the free feed that circulates and shares data to a web browser that can be loaded on the pi zero tablets of the trash wizards is a project that should be worked on immediately.

    "•\tThe construction of a free thing must create value from “nothing”, which can be a medium of economic exchange \n",
    "outside the world of central bank debt\n",
    " \n",
    "It’s clear why I have to start with the motor here: without a free motor, it’s impossible to build anything else free because it would require automation using motors from the old system.  With a *class* of motor that can be built to many specifications, a whole electromechanical technology can be built from the ground up that is all free in this sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the connection between free hardware and open source hardware? Open source hardware does not at all have to be free: it can require a vastly expensive factory to actually produce, as long as the design is publicly available.  This maintains the power relationships of industrial capitalism: the means of production remain safely in the hands of the capitalists, we are just re-aranging how we share amongst ourselves.  The difference between free and open can be more subtle for software where it’s always free in the sense that it can be copied an infinite number of times for no cost in principle.  Hardware on the other hand is not just information.  Without supply chains that are wrested from the control of the masters of the system, what is or is not free is affected very little by “open source” hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important shortcoming in the open source model is the lack of demand for the project to be accessible to those outside the technical guild that built it.  This is not as bad as it used to be, but it’s still common practice for “open” to mean a thing has horrible documentation and usability as contrasted to “closed” commercial software.  What this really does is *further* enforce the class divisions in capitalist society by making a hierarchy of who gets free stuff and who doesn’t.  Those who are in the software tech guild can get free things that are unusable to a normal person, and which have such opaque help  that no one outside the guild can be reasonably expected to figure it out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoiding this shortcoming of open source software in the free hardware project will be particularly tricky.  This means that if you want to use a permanent magnet and coils of current carrying wire for a thing, the quality of applied physics education you make available to your user determines the freeness or non freeness of your technology.  That means that any free electromechanical technology is not really deployed until a whole curriculum is made freely available on classical mechanics and electrodynamics.  That curriculum must be held to much higher standards than are presently applied for college or high school physics education.  It must be very applied, with direct numerical examples throughout which can be used live using python notebooks.  Also it must be able to cater to a very diverse range of learning styles: hands on, mathematical, theoretical, visual, etc etc.  *All* of these must be made freely available in multiple open free formats.  It must be possible to do this with printed pages and no computer or with any type of computer or personal device and no printer(either).  When the thing is built, it must have information printed on it or embedded in some obvious way, which links back to the main free storehouse of documentation.  That documentation must also be decentralized to prevent any authority from destroying the information.\n",
    "\n",
    "This imperative really affects the way that progress moves along.  A working wire coil is not enough.  It must be well characterized and documented with a series of easily accessible physics experiments.  There must be youtube and instructables content showing how to put it together.  These experiments lead to a very fractal level of digression, but in the end they lead to absurdly robust technology which can be recreated from scratch by anyone anywhere quickly.\n",

I want to see a damped LC oscillator, measure Q and resonant frequency for a few C values to determine L, then see how L is affected by various high permeability objects placed in or around the coil.\n",

My answer is to watch closely everything that has anything to do with Raspberry Pi and other “internet of things” projects in the open hardware domain.  I say “open hardware” here and not free hardware, because it’s not free according to my strict definition: it relies on mine-driven fab and capitalism, and there is IP in the supply chain(and some other problems).

This will be a combination of figuring out sourcing logistics on the hardware, making the software closer to what a phone user expects, and writing new software to make more free infrastructure that runs on the free hardware.  If a truly free platform were to allow for the kind of peer to peer labor and goods sharing that for profit platforms now have, capitalism might just collapse overnight as people spontaneously are able to work and do things by communicating freely.\n",

    "I met with my former colleagues today, talking about my old field, quantum information.  The whole world’s gone crazy and it’s hilarious.\n",
    "Here is my short history of quantum computing:\n",
    "1.\tin the 1980s Feynman proposes that quantum mechanics might lead to different rules for computation, and that that might be useful for physics simulations. It’s purely speculative, everyone thinks it’s cool, but nothing happens.\n",
    "2.\tIn the 90s, papers are written showing that quantum computing is relevant to factoring numbers, i.e. code breaking.  The NSA decides to spend some money to make sure no one else develops it and to keep their hand in.  Physicists see it as a way to fund neat quantum toys and take the NSA money, but mostly don’t believe they can really build the thing.\n",
    "3.\tIn the early 2000s things start look a bit more optimistic, more government agencies get into the action, other countries ramp up, a couple big companies get into it.\n",
    "4.\tBy 2010 or so things are looking like someone might really build the damn thing, the US intelligence community ramps up funding aggressively.\n",
    "5.\tAt the exact same time a massive tech bubble appears, and everyone spending money on anything tech related loses their minds.\n",
    "6.\tPrivate companies like Microsoft and Google start a massive arms race to wherever the hell all this is going.\n",
    "7.\tNow this is the hilarious part. The private sector is now “the competition”.  That’s right, these giant companies built in the heart of the military industrial complex are now filling the same role as the USSR in the cold war.  If the feds don’t pour more money in faster, some damn googlers might get there first, and we’ll have a quantum gap on our hands!  But if the government moves faster, the private sector won’t be able to lock the whole field up in criminally insane patents!  So the companies better spend faster!!! Spend! MOar quantum!!!!\n",
    "8.\tWhat’s next?  Will the quantum bubble burst?  Will the private sector lose interest  with a lack of killer app they care about and the intelligence community decide to spend the money on Arabic translators instead of futuristic gizmos?  Will it turn out that the quantum computer changes everything and builds Skynet or some more optimistic version?  Personally I think it’s got a long way to go and actually will be useful.  I think that \n",
    "1.\tBecause of the crypto implications NSA will spend aggressively for the foreseeable future no matter what anyone else does\n",
    "2.\tAs long as that source of funding exists, the private sector will match spending to get a piece of perceived future action on government contracts\n",
    "3.\tThe killer app will be *exactly* what Feynman said it would be 30 years ago: simulation of systems dominated by quantum mechanics.  Theoretical materials science that leads to new materials that can be useful.  Or something.  I’m skeptical that it will have a huge impact on society given that I think future technology should focus on re-use of material only and not creating new materials, but for people stuck in the old economy the implications could be huge.  And if they build new materials, those eventually end up in the land fills of the world to be scavenged by the Trash Wizards\n"

    "# High Voltage DC electrostatic motors \n",
    "\n",
    "Water has a HUGE dielectric constant.  But if it has junk in it it conducts electricity. So with distilled pure water constantly available, it may be desirable to do mechanical work immersed in clean distilled water, so that the force of the various electrostatic motors is multiplied up by this dielectric constant.  Of course the drag of water is huge compared to air and vacuum(in this case just mechanical losses of the moving piece of material), so that can be an issue based on speed.  It’s a tradeoff.  If you want really fast things to happen you need to have no fluids around, but if you want more force slower, you want to be immersed in water for the tiger force.  Again, it’s the concept of mechanical impedance, and water immersion is the choice for high impedance while vacuum and gas are for low impedance.  Development of this technology should happen in parallel in vacuum, air, and distilled water(and maybe some non distilled water, where current might be useful).\n",

    "Also electrochemistry is useful.  Electricity combined with fluids and various metal sources can be used to move metal atoms around from one place to another.  This will be a fantastic way to grab hard to get atoms from a submerged junk car.  Again, these techniques reward patience: given enough time it should be possible to get just about every single atom of a junk car out and used in something, even if in some cases it takes years.  But if it is reclaiming dead land, does not cause harm, and takes no significant human labor, who cares?  Let it eat the car.  So one member of the early team is an expert in electrochemistry.  What else do we need?  Perhaps a cadre of professors with existing programs that line up with the overall mission is needed.  I need to compose the list of experts next.\n",

    "# How to Build the Team to build the Technology \n",
    "\n",
    "I’m clearly not going to build all the things I’m describing here. And even the things I do build, I hope to have what I build be a insignificant fraction of the total number of units produced in the future.  How to recruit? Who to recruit?  Where will they work? I’ve been contemplating these questions, and I see several ways to proceed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Largely the various ways forward will involve decisions about where to be on the spectrum of working inside the system vs. outside.  Some choices will involve getting very conventional, and I fear they will end up being coopted by the existing system.  One of those would be to structure the way ARPA was in ins heyday.  Many top academic, corporate, and government research labs could receive targeted funds to work on problems, where the funds come from various donations and military applied science grant money.  The work would then be done by the usual suspects: grad students, post docs, and various staff researchers inside the current system.  I think the biggest danger here is that the developed technologies will not be free in the real sense because it’s so hard for a expensive R&D lab to ever build a thing that’s not based on expensive equipment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way forward is to focus on commercial applications in the old economy.  One could for instance build a very reliable and cheap water pump, and build a rapidly growing for-profit company on that which funds R&D to free technology through its profits.  This is, I think, the worst of all possible choices.  Capitalism poisons everything it touches.  And I think the way I’m going to define capitalism for the purpose of this work is “the belief that value can be measured using numbers”.  It’s that simple.  Any kind of money or equivalent value unit that can be counted is the poison we all know from our capitalist nightmare, and that’s what I’m going to focus on purging from the technological supply chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the other end of the spectrum, one imagines seizing a abandoned factory building and building the R&D infrastructure up from scratch in a squat environment.  I predict that going too far down this path ends with the usual endless war with cops and landlords that always happens when good people try to use land without the System.  Even if you imagine buying the land so that there are no direct legal challenges, cops and landlords will be an ever-present problem, as will generating enough federal reserve debt to keep the bastards off our backs.  A lot of time will have to be spent on just keeping the site running.\n",
    "\n",
    "Seizing land and building up the means of production makes sense when you have a working technology that can be instantly deployed and then also broken down and moved later when you need to move.  But before the technology is mature, it makes sense to be completely distributed geographically.  Also, for this project to work as I want it too, we need strong cooperation between the developing world and the developed world, and between diverse people living on land that has different types of local resources available from whatever their local trash streams are, as well as the very diverse energy considerations, and the diverse cultural considerations which should be considered early not later.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does this distributed system work? I believe part of it involves the structure of the actual book document.  I don’t feel that the Jupiter notebooks are quite where I want them yet, but they’re close, and I think that the structure will be based on software that comes out of that basic structure.  Users will make modules to solve various technical problems, as well as post new ones, and they’ll all be integrated into the combined book.  This is, in many ways, what the open source software people do using their git hub bullshit.  I think git up is a giant festering piece of shit, however, and loathe most software communities, so this is a tricky game.  Somehow the innovations from that world should be used without poisoning the whole project and creating yet another tech bro shit head club.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way I want to differentiate from a lot of computer software bullshit is by having a coherent narrative.  Something that drives me crazy about their culture is that things are so distributed that you can’t actually figure out where to start.  It’s not just that there are forks, it’s that there are *many* forks all the time for everything and everyone is a giant dick about all of it.  I’m not above simply banning anyone with any tech company affiliations from contributing to the main document.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a book.  A book is a finite thing.  As time goes on content will be added, but other content will also be deleted.  It will all be archived, but if someone wants to they can approach from zero, start at the beginning, and have a coherent narrative to follow as they build up to actually having the ability to use the technology themselves.  There will be various versions to account for many human languages as well as some various tracks that might exist, but all of the parallel versions and tracks must be self contained and linear(or at least with the option of treating them as linear).  I need to keep a very close eye on how things progress with the various jupiter like things out there, because it’s moving fast.  It all has to work on a free trash wizard stick, but that should be fine with the HTML5 stuff that everything now runs on inside a browser.  Is there a simple way to go back and forth between jupiter notebooks and a fully compiled .pdf in book format?  Surely there is, and if not, it should be some combination of existing scripts chained together.\n",
    "\n",
    "My job as initial author is to create well posed problems in the first draft of the book, and to make it appealing for people to contribute solutions to those problems. This will be extremely hard to get right on a first pass, and part of getting this whole thing to work will involve shifting that format over time.  When things are really working, the R&D will be all done in the value circle economy, where people are constantly creating that form of value as they do R&D.  This has the potential to be a very hard chicken-and-egg problem: the book needs a lot of work in order to have value circles work, but without value circles people can’t work on it effectively.  That’s why this all starts with me working alone in my underwear at home.  And remains that way for a while.  Because I need to first have the system working with me as the only user, then me and some close associates, then a few “followers” who just build kits, and then, when that team has worked for a few years, more people can ease their way into the system to grow it.  Of course as the serial/parallel global crises of capitalist disaster accelerate, we may find that things grow explosively instead.  If that happens it happens, but I will plan for something that is built much more carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "This blog post was going to go into a list if the types of experts needed to get the various jobs done, but on looking where it ended up going that looks more and more like a useless exercise at this time.  I’ll build up the vision of what should get built, build my own parts of that technology and distribute them, and then a sort of chemical potential will form which brings in the right experts.  It’s dangerous to specify exact professional qualifications too early, as it will end up losing out on some opportunities to bring in talent outside the organized technical professions, which creates lots of biases in class, race, nationality, age, etc.  It’s much better to pose problems clearly with no jargon, in as many ways as possible and just see who turns up with a solution.\n"

    "\n",
    "I finally made a motor with three coils in a triangle.  It was a healthy reminder that this is what I’m fighting against in my design philosophy.  Why do I hate motors as they are designed now?  Because they’re not human technology.  They work “well” in efficiency, power, or whatever else engineers choose to optimize for but they are touchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you crudely make a triangle with duct tape and 3d printed hand wound coils, then tape some magnets to a shaft in a couple ball bearings and drive the field around in a circle, it sucks.  You can make it spin fast and with a reasonable amount of torque, but it stalls totally at random and reverses direction, oscillates, etc.  It’s bullshit.  Now, I’m doing a lot of things shitty here, so it’s to be expected.  I have no feedback, am not bothering with PWM, just doing all on or all off, use only one direction for each coil, and only sort of have the coils lined up right, and there’s some lateral play in the position of the coils relative to the shaft, which also wiggles.  But that same setup with just a single coil, with just one direction and no PWM, works comparatively smoothly.  It’s bidirectional, but doesn’t stall very easily and restarts quickly.  Pretty much any distance will work for driving the magnet, and any magnet shape, etc.  So a human can get it all tuned up by hand trivially with any of many possible arrangements.\n",
    "\n",
    "And that is the goal!!! Human technology, that you can modify and understand easily, that you don’t have to be some fancy pants engineer to use or understand or modify.  What was missing until today was a way to use my system to apply a bias to the direction so that you can have the motor go one way or the other and select that with software.  I think there are a lot of ways to solve this problem, but my solution is: two drive coils, angled about 120 degrees from each other, next to each other, with a sense coil between them pointed in toward the same center as the drive coils.  One drive coil is repulsive and one is attractive, and they’re triggered by the sign of the EMF in the pickup coil.  The flux maximum and minimum are when the magnets are aligned or anti aligned with the pickup coil, so this is where the time derivative is zero, so also where the EMF is zero.  Thus that line of symmetry between he drive coils defines the line of sign change of the drive.  Switch which coil is triggered by which sign and you switch the direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "This simple system should work to make controlled motors that can switch direction for turning wheels with some torque. That means I can make a wheelie cart controlled over the wifi network as well as a coil winding machine, both of which are important milestones in this project.  Also, I *think* a small variation of this should work to drive magnets around in an oscillatory  orbit in one direction or the other, possibly working for pump action.\n"

Basically it’s a Arduino pro mini clone but with a drive transistor that can drive up to 2 A and 60 V to drive a coil, and a op amp to measure another pickup coil, two buttons, a knob, a couple other breakouts, an on/off switch, a pilot LED, and a DC power input connector.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code on the micro controller lets the user switch between two modes in the current version.  In the first one, the user can push  button to make the drive coil go on, release it to turn it off, and it spits out data from the output of the op amp over the serial which can be graphed on the new Arduino IDE(1.6.6).  The second mode is where the magic happens: the amplified signal from the pickup coil is fed back to determine when the drive coil is engaged.  Thus a force is applied always with the same sign as the velocity of the driven permanent magnet, making a dynamic resonant drive.  I.e. as the thing is driven harder and the frequency changes, the drive moves to adapt, and it always hits resonance.\n",

I mean it’s super useful, and in the long run I think everyone will want this technology, but as a weird toy between experiment and product? Maybe.  Whatever.

    "# In defense of certain units \n",
    "\n",
    "First of all let’s get one thing straight: the United States is not only a signatory to the Treaty of the Meter, we are one of the most significant contributors in the world to that system.  Known by the American public as “the metric system” and by scientists as the “SI”, the international standard of units is just as much the law of the land in the U.S. as it is anywhere else.  When we use a non-metric unit like the foot or the yard, there is no legal or scientific ambiguity.  A yard is 0.9144 meters, exactly, and a foot is 1/3 of a yard exactly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The meter is defined to extremely high precision and accuracy off of the atomic clock and the fixed speed of light in a way that all signatories to the meter treaty agree upon, and which the US is very much part of maintaining.   A legal agreement from the 1950s connects anything in the Imperial distance system back to the legally agreed upon meter.  So all this blather about the US being “behind” or “primitive” for “not being on the metric system” seems like a lot of hot air to me.  The SI allows for use of units outside the official base and derived units as long as the relationship to the official units is defined.  A unit I personally find much more annoying than the inch or foot is the Angstrom.  I know it’s useful for atomic physics and chemistry, but once something is bigger than 1 nm, why the hell add a zero?  Yet doing that is not a American tic in particular, and seems to infest science labs all over the world for some reason.\n",
    "\n",
    "But it is not my plan to talk about any of that here. I want to defend the use of the psi, or pounds per square inch and the psig, or pounds per square inch gauge.  First of all, these both measure pressure. Pressure is the amount of force on some surface area per unit area.  Thus, if you multiply a pressure by an area you get a force.  If the pressure is in pounds per square inch and you multiply by an area in square inches you get a force in pounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "But of course this is not the SI unit of pressure.  The SI unit of pressure is the pascal (official SI usage indicates named units like this are not capitalized unless abbreviated, e.g. “kelvin” not “Kelvin” and “ampere” not “Ampere” even though those are symbolized by capital K and A).  The SI unit of force is the newton, and area is of course square meters.  So one pascal is one newton per square meter.  And that is a TINY pressure.  Atmospheric pressure at sea level is about 101,000 pascals.  So any talk of pressure of weather or gasses near atmospheric pressure will always deal with 100,000’s of pascals or 100’s of kPa.  This has led to the common use in physical sciences of the “bar” and the “millibar”, which are 100,000 pascals and 100 pascals, respectively.  So we say that atmospheric pressure is about 1 bar at sea level and about 850 millibar in Denver, one mile above sea level.  I think this is a pretty good unit for a lot of things since it relates back to pascals easily and also to atmosphere, which we often care about in science.  In the USA and I think Italy the torr is also often used. Since 760 Torr = 1 atmosphere it is similar in order of magnitude to a millibar and when things are only done to an order of magnitude people often use them as close to equivalent.  I have no defense of the torr. On the other hand I am not sure it does much harm, it’s just a crappy unit used when you don’t care much about the exact value of things you probably are not measuring that accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "But why do I care about the psi?  Because of its amazingly simple conversion between practical force values and practical pressure values.  Even if you’re not familiar with psi if you know what a pound and an inch is, it’s pretty obvious if you know how to divide things on a calculator.  And that often yields numbers which are not just easy to understand, they can aid in safe handling of high and low pressure systems.  It’s not always obvious that a “small” pressure in a tank of gas or liquid will cause the kind of destruction that can happen all to easily in systems with pumps.  But suppose you have 1 psi pushing on a thin sheet metal panel that’s about 3 yards X 3 yards.  That’s about 10,000 square inches.  So multiplying by 1 you instantly see that that is 10,000 pounds.  Can thin aluminum sheet handle that? Or a large glass window?  No.  But wait, there’s more!  pressure is usually measured in a physics lab as an absolute quantity.  Thus atmospheric pressure is, as stated above, about 101 kPa.  But in the every day world it often makes more sense to measure all pressure not relative to a vacuum but relative to atmospheric pressure.  Atmospheric pressure at sea level is about 14.7 psi, so conversion to this relative measure involves subtracting 14.7 from absolute pressure, or a bit less at altitude.  And now we’ve finally arrived at the “psig”, which is probably the most common pressure unit used in a lot of gas and fluid engineering applications, and with good reason.\n",
    "\n",
    "Going back to the window example, a window sitting in air at atmospheric pressure has many 10’s of thousands of pounds of force pushing it from both sides which exactly cancel.  That’s an interesting science fact but not useful for figuring out when air will break the window.  On the other hand, if you read literature on the effect of nuclear weapons, the shock wave from the blast is generally characterized in psi of overpressure, effectively the same as psig, in radii going out from the blast center.  And suddenly this makes horrifying sense.  2 psi overpressure on a big window really is many 10’s of thousands of pounds being suddenly applied to ONE side of the window.  This will not only destroy the window, but if you scale it up to buildings you get even more astronomical forces pointing in all the wrong directions and the devastation makes physical sense.  It only takes single digits of psi overpressure to cause total destruction of all structures in the path of a blast wave.\n",
    "\n",
    "These pictures of destruction are part of why I think psi and psig are important.  One very important thing you get by subtracting atmospheric pressure is the appearance of negative pressures.  Suppose now you have a large fuel tank that is at “only” -1 psig, or 1 psi of vacuum.  Again, you can add up that pressure difference over the area, and imagine this happened to one of those huge tanks used for storage by refineries.  Approximate this as a cube 40 feet on a side, and you get 5*(40*12)^2 = about 1 MILLION pounds.  The moral of the story is a small sounding pressure difference of 1 psi can cause incredible destructive force again, causing huge steel structures to collapse like a aluminum beer can in your hand very quickly.  And as you know from beer and pop cans, crushing them takes way less force than exploding them.  This means that the same vessel that works great as a space ship(i.e. inflated metal bag of air) will collapse instantly under even small amounts of vacuum when in atmosphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus I argue that the psi and psig are not only useful for students of physics to learn more viscerally what pressure is, but are relevant to safety of technicians using systems with pumps and plumbing in them.  The average technician, even in a country that is “on the metric system” might or might not be familiar with the whole conversion system between bar, millibar, pascals, newtons, meters, square cm etc.  But every plumber or welder in the US can readily convert psi to pounds and say “holy shit that’s a lot of pounds”.  And it’s that “holy shit” factor which can contribute in tangible ways to the safety of pressure and vacuum systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "From an education standpoint I see no excuse not to learn all of them, however: psi, psig, pascals, bar, millibar, and torr.  Because they’ll all come up.  All these units are all around you, at least in the US, and they’re not going away, you should know all of them if you want to get anything done with vacuums and high pressures.  But what I’m arguing for is after you learn all of them, don’t be a dick about all the people in blue collar technical positions who rely on psi.  It’s a fine unit.  Learn it, love it.\n"

    "I woke up this morning with a sudden realization.  I’ve been trying to think how the free motor and free technology movement can have physical space and legal existence.  I was thinking of various non profit structures, squats, even religious organization structures.  And then I realized: universities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Universities were around before the rise of the modern military industrial corporate state, and they’ll be around after.  In some ways they’ve become less and less relevant, as the most economically valued skills are not taught there, the debt trap ruins many lives, and what used to be a “liberal education” is so watered down as to have no value above the practical.  The size of administration continues to grow out of control, faculty have more and more miserable jobs as the pressure of completion adds up, even after the tenure race.  Students are encouraged to party for 5 years of pointless “education” before their life long debt peonage begins.  Research that is supposedly “knowledge seeking” is more and more a R&D arm for corporate America and the military.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in spite of all that the power held by universities is staggering.  Yale is the largest land owner in the state of Connecticut, they own over half the hospitals in the state, and control much of the area around their home town of New Haven.  Their endowment is well over 10 billion dollars, on which they consistently earn extremely high returns.  They have consistently had graduates controlling both the supreme court and the presidency for much of the last 100 years.  This sort of thing is also true of many large western public schools, and while less true going down the hierarchy of schools, the overall amount of land, money, power, and influence is large for the whole system.  And in many ways universities are allowed to exist outside our capitalist system already.\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously they’re still very capitalist, but just the fact that there are so many car free spaces is very unusual for just about anything in our society.  What else is like that?  Corporations have huge green campuses, which you always have to drive to, and which almost never have housing.  And they’re usually very utilitarian, clearly intended to NOT have the employees lounge around all day playing frisbee on the grounds.\n",
    "I see this as a distributed campus movement which can exist as organizations on a campus, re-organized departments, takeovers of failing universities, political culture shifts in successful established universities, abandoned factory occupations, and finally full launching of new universities from scratch, buying land, raising big donor funds and all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accreditation would not be a goal initially, we’d call it a non-accredited technical university and deal with that later.  No tuition would be paid, housing and food would all be free as available.  No one would pay or be paid, no materials would be paid for or bought.  Supply chains would be established to pipe industrial waste streams to the campus for free.  everyone is staff, everyone is student, and everyone is faculty, after they get some minimum level.  Education achievement is denoted more like the martial arts than in school: degrees are awarded in systems, with pedigree noted and recorded.  Students do not graduate, they simply become more skilled as time goes on, and produce more and more useful knowledge which they can pass on to both more students and the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "The work and learning and research are all the process of building full robot communism on the campus.  The waste stream builds the robots, which can be sold for federal reserve debt to get leverage with the capitalist world, as well as the robots that build out the food production.  The initial plan has to address the land use issues: there has to be enough water, air, soil, sun, and open space to carry out industrial production, food production, energy production(this is critical!!), classroom education, student and research lab work(which should overlap in space if not completely in time). This means sitting is very important.  A school that is totally on board with the project and has a great team etc. but is in the middle of a desert or has a totally urban campus with no rural land, or has no on site renewables should be ruled out initially to make the experiment a success.\n",
    "\n",
    "This idea of students staying for life, and contributing to a  post capitalist industrial society also solves one of the main flaws in academia: exponential growth.  In the current system, a top professor might create several dozen phd’s during their career.  That means that for all those people to find jobs like their advisor, the number of available jobs has to go up by several dozen over a couple academic generations.  While post WWII growth in the sciences was often exponential, it was nowhere near steep enough, ever, to make these numbers work out.  The vast majority of phd’s have always, and continue, to have to leave and find other work unrelated to what they studied.  Even if they’re lucky enough to get a good job, it’s always at a rival school to their advisor, so they are automatically forced into competition, destroying the benefit that could happen if a team stayed together for decades, learning and working(this is why national labs are often more productive than university labs).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this free university system, however, students who have learned skills and ideas from someone for the last 10 years will often spend another 10 years working with that person to grow their work.  And this CAN grow exponentially, since the idea is to build a industrial ecosystem that can grow organically to eventually take over from all the elements of the capitalist world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Faculty are recruited based on their willingness and ability to tackle the major problems which are on the university’s “problem list”.  Problems can be added in any field, and addressed with faculty hires, and new perspective faculty can pitch new problems to add to the list.  However no effort is made to “fill out” existing categories outside the problems to be solved.  And economists are banned by policy unless a special exception is made based on a consistent pattern of radicalism.  No theorists.  No guns. No weapons research.  No anti personnel specific weapons can be made or used including tasers and their ilk.  On site security will be by the judo team.\n",
    "Politically, governance will be mixed.  In some cases a project or lab may be a pure collective, in others a more authoritarian structure, in others a democratic mix.  The default is temporary autonomous zone, where the temporary part is largely\n",
    "\n",
    "All work done at the university is truly free: no copyrights, no patents, all publications in the public domain, all publications have layman versions which the public can understand and follow if they need your technology.  Technology developed must be able to be built without mining.  Exchange is based on a  growing system of value circles, and described elsewhere, creating an economic system which can grow with a steep exponent independent of and mostly unregulated by capitalism.\n",
    "\n",
    "If professors want to consult or still be attached to other universities while at the free university, so be it.  They can get federal reserve debt that way, as can students.  Eventually students could get accreditation that would allow them access to the graduate school system in the outside, so politically strong ties with the existing university system are important.  This must not be seen as just an insurgency, but rather as a process to save the spirit of curiosity and good will and fix the debt problem for students.  If presented correctly this can be viewed by the academy as a means of both self preservation and ultimately growth in power and prestige(both of which they’re losing).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking forward, imagining that this is successful, it’s staggering to contemplate the level of power that could be wielded by the post capitalist industrial quasi-state that is the free university network.  What if the Ivy League could be converted by a series of political takeovers on their various corporate boards?  Cornell now owns Roosevelt Island.  One could imagine a sort of shadow borough in New York, which feeds off of the city’s ludicrously massive waste stream and the tidal energy from the East river and builds out a whole post capitalist industrial infrastructure right in the heart of one of the centers of global capitalism.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, it’s also critical that society at large see this as an asset not a liability.  Autonomous zones usually exist in a grey area where they are either barely tolerated by the state or they get fully criminalized, with military attacks by police.  But what about zones controlled by the universities, big companies or the military(or all three)?  These spaces get huge latitude because they are part of the underlying system: industrial society needs those spaces.  If the free university system makes technology that people need and produce media that people like and use, that will be viewed in the same light that universities have in the best of times: as pure creators of knowledge needed by all, and thus protected by the state.  If this is done correctly, a state within a state can grow not only outside capitalism but in symbiosis with it on both sides: capitalists get free knowledge and stuff and we get free metal, stone, land etc. from them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also note that while the university should have no internal budget in fed dollars, it will have various revenue streams most likely.  With no taxes or expenses, what happens to this fed debt money?  One of the ways it can get used is to pay the local town more than usual for the voluntary real estate tax.  Legally the universities don’t have to pay land tax, but the big powerful ones do voluntarily for political leverage locally.  These are often pathetically small sums compared to the university’s operating budget or endowment.  With no expenses a free school could easily multiply those numbers by 10, changing the relationship with the town qualitatively.  Given that universities already wield almost godlike powers in their local towns a lot of times, this would effectively give complete control over the town, preventing opposition from city or county zoning authorities.   This brings up another major advantage of universities: no one thinks it’s weird for there to be high density housing there, and also huge industrial facilities.  Where I went to college there were seemingly endless rows of 8 story high dorm housing for blocks, right on campus land.   We also had a nuclear reactor.  Where else can that happen?  Where else can you put a weird little stone hut in the middle of a corporate property and have a senior employee live in it with their dog?\n",
    "\n",
    "Dealing with heat and AC and power in the post capitalist world is the first task, which the start team has to solve.  I’m pretty sure the plan for how to ramp up this free university distributed campus is going to be a whole book chapter in the upcoming manifesto.\n",

    "# Novelty in Science \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the many things I think has gone wrong with science is the obsession with novelty.  All of the incentives that influence the actions of professional scientists are biased toward a very narrow definition of novelty.  For the private sector scientist, patents and new markets are the motivation, for an academic scientist it’s publications, prestige, and expansion of influence in the field.  For government it’s somewhere in between these.\n",
    "\n",
    "What this means is that a trivial result involving whatever the latest trendy physical system is always gets precedent over a useful result on something like water or guitar strings.  The example I’m the most familiar with is in quantum “computing”.  The most trendy work in that field gets published in both Science and Nature routinely.  Why is this?  Is it because those are applied journals that track pure engineering advances?  No, clearly not.  Is it that the results of the top groups in the quantum computing field are fundamentally advancing quantum theory?  Again, clearly not; most of the results are based on math worked out over 80 years ago.  So why Nature and Science?  Because the systems are trendy, of course!\n",
    "\n",
    "Now someone might argue that all this is ok, because there is a great reason those systems are trendy: they might actually yield a amazing new kind of computer!    Perhaps.  But if that’s true, and the value of this work is all how it pushes the practical engineering gaol forward, it seems clear these publications are driven by all the wrong metrics.  But the way these papers are written and treated by the peers who read them is in fact not about practicality at all.  It’s about “demonstrating quantum mechanics”, presumably some new neat wave function or something.  Again, that is something I think has value, but again it’s way off base from how it’s sold.   If you really want to understand some simple interaction of a harmonic oscillator and two level system, you find classical systems of coupled modes that do the same thing.  So if you are driven by pedagogy, demonstrations, and curiosity, do you do the cavity QED experiment or the electromechanical experiment at room temperature in audio frequencies?  Surely mechanical and acoustic vibration machines are more relevant to natural curiosity, since they’re in the world we actually can experience physically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Who cares, what’s wrong with all this, and why is it like this?  I believe all this obsession is about money, power, and control.  If you view the primary objective of a wealthy professional class to expand and preserve itself, the current regime makes sense.  As long as anything involving clever use of coupled modes to do useful things means expensive lasers and exotic materials or gasses, it continues to be controlled by those who already control those gatekeeper materials.  If young students of the physical sciences were trained in practical use of physical ideas to interact with the world, they would not need the system that created them, and each generation would pass on control to the next with unknown consequences.    To me that’s the heart of what this is all about: control.  The purpose of the modern university system has *always* been to create a malleable class of corporate soldiers to keep the system running.  And the supposedly practical departments should be viewed through that sense every bit as much as the more overtly ideological political science and economics departments.\n",
    "\n",
    "I argue for a physics education based on free people teaching free people in freedom for free.  That is I want to teach people practical physics completely outside the system, geared toward owning the power that this physics can control, including the power to pass those skills on.  Onward to the revolution.\n"

    "\n",
    "Well, I made a motor that spins, and it’s really fun!  The feedback is as in the vibrational motors I’ve been making, and it just pushes the magnet whenever it’s going away then is off as the magnet spins around.  This gives fast and strong rotation as long as there is a reasonable bearing of some kind, and as long it starts going the direction you want it to.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a couple problems, however: a lack of direction and the half period during which there is no drive, when a stall can happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "An obvious and clearly workable next step is to go up to a full 4 coils, and ping them all in order as in a DC brushless motor.  But I don’t want to jump into that too fast.  My goal is not to reproduce the DC brushless motor, my goal is a motor that truly can be built and understood and modified by non experts.  One of the requirements here is that I don’t just want a unique design which works and can be copied.  I want a class of designs which are so clear that almost no prior understanding is needed to make it work, fix it, and mess with it.  What I want is a directional feedback, a very simple way that a pair of coils can have a feedback drive like what I have now, but with a second axis added and the relative position of the second coil determining the direction of rotation.  This can work for linear drives, rotational drives, part of a rotational drive with multiple coils, or resonant orbital drives that are used for bouncing robots and possibly ornithopter drones.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I’m going to pause to slowly mess around with the phase of the second pulse and the position of the second coil, and get that smooth before moving on from the rotational motor.  If that works, I should be able to make a simple wheeled robot that can be directed around over bluetooth or wifi.\n",
    "I can also make a simple magic wand style vibrator out of this version of the motor, although that should not need as sophisticated a drive(since direction doesn’t matter).\n",
    "\n",
    "But if I’m going to stay focused on the main long term goal, the first thing to make with a rotational motor is a coil winding machine.  Then I need to figure out how to make the coils from a found object, how to make that in bulk, and actually go out and make 100 or so of these things.   And build the beginnings of a magnet supply chain, do some snooping on how to dumpster the hard drives I need around Denver.  Then tighten up the design of the control board, get some more ordered and assembled and tested, and FINALLY get into the energy storage side of things.  Then ARM controller, internet connection, software, more robots, build ice factory.\n"

    "# On Why Cryptography is Bullshit \n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously cryptography has its uses in today’s society, but when it comes to building the tools we need for a better society it is bullshit.  It’s no accident the same people who are obsessed with cryptography are often obsessed with guns and other weapons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do I hate cryptography? Why not just ignore it if I don’t like it?  Proponents claim cryptography can free us all from having various communications spied on by “the enemy”.  This enemy can be various criminal agents as well as the federal government which is what crypto people are generally the most worried about.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, I have a degree in math, and I kind of like math, can learn it reasonably easily, so I have tried to learn something about crypto.  Honestly I find it impenetrable.  Everything is not only based on pretty hard number theory, in order to actually make it work there are a ton of subtleties that are not pure math at all, but are more applied computer science.  And on top of this everything you read about crypto comes with DIRE warnings against trying to write it yourself out of some simple script, so that you control what’s happening.  We, the technically competent non-initiates to the technocratic priesthood of IT, are told that without members of the priesthood blessing a given piece of code it should NEVER be trusted.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the struggle for the supposed freedom of using cryptography for all communications always leads down a circular road back to the same technocrats we’re trying to escape. We’re told that, essentially, it’s really important to pick the RIGHT members of the technocratic priesthood to trust.  But why the FUCK should anyone trust people from the tech industry at all? The fact that our lives are all online with shit security, and that this affects all of our ability to function in society comes entirely from the world these same techno priests built.  If you don’t want tech industry elites to control your life, entrusting your secrets to more of them will never be the answer.  Personally I advocate smashing your smart phone, replacing it with a burner flip phone, and leaving that turned off in your desk drawer(works for me).\n",
    "\n",
    "But let’s go back to the problem the paranoid crypto nerds are claiming to solve: intrusion of government into our lives.  They get super hysterical if you say you don’t need crypto and have endless reasons that having nothing to hide doesn’t mean you don’t need privacy.  Fine.  But this totally misses the point.  Most of us care about the practicality of all this: are we going to be harassed by the State?  Will political opinions or affiliations lead to government oppression?  Will minor non violent drug offenses lead to long prison terms?  Will we have to watch everything we say because of the “big brother” listening?\n",
    "\n",
    "All this is a total red herring.  Oppressive states don’t oppress because they have the most expensive computers in the world, they oppress because they’re oppressive.  North Korea probably has some of the shittiest IT infrastructure on the planet, and has arguably the most repressive government on the planet.  Meanwhile South Korea is a relatively free society with some of the most “big brother”-ish technology you can imagine(phone apps that know your entire route on public transit at all times, all payments made non-anonymously by smart phone, CCTV everywhere, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want a free society, force police to follow the rule of law, and pass laws that prevent them from oppressive action.  That’s it, that’s all you can do.  The state, as long as it exists, will have the overwhelming advantage in terms of raw force, be it guns, tanks, planes, or computational firepower.  I believe challenges to those authorities are important but that direct attacks/defenses based on firepower will always fail.  If you don’t have the kind of state that can listen to reason, revolution can be needed but that can only work by ultimately getting a lot of people to switch to your side, including those in the old system.  It works that way for every coup, worked that way for the Bolsheviks getting the Tsarist troops to switch over, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also think there is a utopian argument against the world view of the crypto people.  I argue that one of the things that is wrong with our world is all the secrecy and paranoia.  In the name of national security the states of the world(and a whole bunch of private sector collaborators) have classified as secret huge swaths of our global industrial system from secret plutonium factories to secret prisons.  I would say anyone who’s world view I think should actually be listened to would agree that this has gone way to far and that a whole lot of light shining in the dark places in the world would be good for everyone.  Fewer secrets, fewer lies–that’s how I think the world should be. But we’re told by various tech people that lies and secrets are great as long as instead of trusting the government with them we trust them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because make no mistake: to trust crypto is to personally trust the techno-elite priesthood.  Just as buying tacos from a sketchy street stand involves trust not in some abstract taco theory but in the actual PERSON standing in that cart cooking the meat, the decision to trust cryptographic technology that is opaque to the vast majority of the world is a very personal trust decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "And why should we trust anyone from tech on this?  While we’re told by the techno elite that they’re the ONLY ones qualified to evaluate the technical soundness of crypto, they would not disagree that on average they’re some of the worst people in our society at judging the human elements of anything.   Because of course no communication channel is ever really just secured by math and code.  All the humans who have the technical and logistical ability to compromise that channel have to be trustworthy.  Every. Single. One.  Conversely if you’re an agent of a government who wants to compromise a server or software or hardware you only need to find one weak link.  It could be the manufacturer of keyboards who you pay to put key loggers in that phone home in some bitstream disguised as noise.  It could be similar backdoors from screen manufacturers, OS backdoors, hacks of low security apps every idiot downloads on their phones, hacks in third party social media apps, etc etc etc.  If you really think that crypto is going to be your main line of safety from oppressive government you have to assume none of these things happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "So even if you really are that paranoid, and you think the feds seriously give a fuck what you have to say, you have to conclude that this is all bullshit.  If you really are that paranoid, if you’re doing the sorts of things that NSA is willing to point their extremely expensive ears at intentionally, you’re a fucking idiot if you trust tech nerds to protect you.  If you want to leak your shit to the Washington Post, put your trench coat on and pass a thumb drive to the reporter in a darkly lit DC bar like a normal fucking person.\n",
    "\n",
    "And what about the coming police state these people claim to fear?  it’s already here if you’re poor or black, and cryptography is sure as shit not helping those people.  Cryptography won’t help a black teenager walk down the street without being shot by the cops, and it won’t help the black guy in the inner city who’s threatened with a long jail term if they do’t collaborate with the cops to inform on people for minor drug offenses.  And what about the organizers who are actually trying to do something about this police state?  Do they need cryptography to organize via twitter and Facebook, get people to show up to public rallies, or bring their message to the media? Obviously not, what they need is the opposite of secrecy, which is generally how activism works.  When a group of mostly men making $100k+/year sit around building technology to control how society communicates that’s the opposite of activism.\n",
    "\n",
    "So why do tech people want to talk about cryptography so much?  I believe it’s nothing more than a power grab.  They may not realize it, but I think tech people are generally blind to the dynamics of their own power structure.  Whether intended or not, the entire trend of crypto as a culture is about the techno elite priesthood grasping an even deeper control over the lives of the rest of us.  Fuck crypto, and fuck the tech industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "10 years ago, I’d rail against the banks and credit card industry because they were clearly forcing Americans into debt slavery on a mass scale.  Everyone looked at me like I was crazy, and didn’t understand why I even viewed credit cards as political.  I think what gets called “tech” now, i.e. the silicon valley elites who are building a internet based power structure, will see their social capital erode in the same way the bankers have in the last 10 years.  Either that or I’ll just completely withdraw from society, because I’d rather live alone in a cabin and forage for berries and rhubarb than live in a world dominated by the tech industry.\n"

    "# The Science I walked Away from \n",
    "\n",
    "The way I’ve experienced science is totally unrelated to how I might have expected it to be based on what I learned in school growing up.  When I look back at the whole thing as I’ve seen it, I see it as a rotten institution that I want to have nothing more to do with.\n",
    "\n",
    "How was I brought up to think it worked based on crap you learn in school and in books?  Curiosity draws the scientist toward some question about how the world works.  Based on existing science knowledge, a hypothesis is formed, and based on scientific skills an experiment is designed to verify or falsify that hypothesis.  Now, with as much objectivity as possible, the researcher carries out the experiment, analyzes the data, and if needed adds some change to the body of what we call knowledge. Then, based on greater knowledge, this all repeats.  All this is glorious and good. If it’s not obvious how great it is, just look at all that great stuff it makes! Antibiotics!  Refrigeration!  Nuclear energy! The future is glorious, and it’s just a natural side effect that this glory reflects on the scientist.  This is as it should be!  Scientists, almost by accident, since they’re driven totally by pure curiosity, happen to produce the raw materials for an infinitely expanding and glorious future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously my views have changed, based on what I’ve seen.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take a look at how my career would have worked had I continued.  I started physics in high school, loved it, wanted to know more, and studied it in college, along with math.  Note that every step of this was influenced by science fiction.  I got sucked into physics and math in middle school because we wanted to understand how someone could build a TARDIS as seen in Dr. Who.  Then in high school, I watched Star Trek, where we learn that the natural next step in science is some kind of application of general relativity and quantum mechanics to understand space time well enough to manipulate it, as in Dr. Who.  We see a future where hundreds of years in the future Einstein and Hawking are both considered important enough that the crew of a space ship play poker with them in their spare time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then I got to college and found out what the science is like that the people who claim to have “gotten Einstein’s office” do.  In short, it sucks.  High energy physics has done nothing useful in decades, either for technology or for understanding how the world really works.  And it’s structured in GIANT hierarchies where almost everyone is a tiny cog in a giant machine. Most likely in that field you will work on something that is engineering, math or management and not science at all in any classic sense of curiosity driven research.  And then, after decades of hard work, you will get some result that is useless to society and the rest of science.  All the while watching your funding slowly diminish in real dollars and crush the culture of your field.  So, fuck that.  Most of the people I went to college with who wanted to do that stuff as freshman figured out otherwise after a couple years or so.  Most of us found that much more interesting work is happening in atomic physics, nuclear physics, biophysics, and solid state physics, or just left altogether.\n",
    "\n",
    "But then as an undergrad I was exposed to yet another sci fi world that changed everything.  I read the Diamond Age by Neal Stephenson, and my whole view changed.  In that book, while dystopian in some ways, there is still a glorious and shiny future available for those who apply physics correctly.  That world was based on “molecular nanotechnology” as described in the 80s and 90s by K. Erik Drexler, Ralph Merkle etc. I *believed* in that!  I was totally obsessed.  I believed I would one day become an immortal planet sized being wandering the universe studying physics if I could just be there when the big breakthrough happened.  That drew me to nano physics/”condensed matter”, and I worked in a top lab at Berkeley for the year in that field after I finished undergrad there.\n",
    "\n",
    "That was super fun, I learned a ton, and it really was a plugged in lab.  Great funding, great facilities, everyone went on to get top jobs, our advisor was super famous etc.  And it led smoothly to another research position based on where I was living the next year, at a top lab at Yale, also in nano physics.of sorts.  That led to a phd, and before graduating I had a job lined up based on connections from that lab.  I ended up going to work for someone whose phd adviser got his phd under the professor who my phd advisor did his post doc under.  I moved fields slightly but ended up back in a field that overlapped with my phd advisor’s phd advisor from caltech.  My point is that this whole process is very much a “family affair”: once you’re in the inner circle of elite science you tend to move around in it based on personal/professional relationships, not based on the science itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be clear, let me go back to the idealized picture from my youth.  I would have imagined something like this: I’m curious about how electricity moves through various materials, so I pick some material that is particularly interesting, dive in, and hope that it turns out to yield fruit.  Nope.  What you work on as a professional scientist is more of a tribal identity than a question that occurred to you based on looking at the world as you find it around you.  Now the caveat to that is you never want to compete directly with your advisor after moving on in your career, because it’s essential that they support you and that goes against that.  Also they have a head start by many years so it’s not a good idea.  So typically what one does is move to a slightly separate sub-tribe for the post doc than you did for the phd.  That’s what I did.  So then, the next step would have been to apply for a “real job” as a faculty member, based on some ambitious hybrid of those main sub-tribes I was exposed to.  Maybe throw in some twist to that that makes it my own, some slightly “new” idea, usually one that’s already around that you know will work, but that is not being pushed at the moment.  It also helps to blend in something fashionable(the role of fads and fashions in science is about 10 more long blog posts so I’ll try not to go into that here).\n",
    "\n",
    "And where would that leave me?  What questions would I be answering if I did that?  In my view, none.  The main “question” if you want to call it that, from my old field is “can the United States government successfully build a quantum computer to break codes?”  That is the central question that all work in my old field feeds into.  People find side questions along the way, but in the end that’s where all the money and power are and if you’re not pushing that objective along, you’ll lose out on both and become irrelevant or unemployed.  And what exactly does this work involve?  Are we building a computer that you can actually use? No. Are we learning how the universe works?  No, quantum mechanics is not being changed by this work, the theory stands as it has for decades in terms of its basic structure and how it explains things like atoms.\n",
    "\n",
    "What it is, in fact, is a sort of stunt based extreme sport.  Just as in skateboarding you’re constantly pushing to ollie over a bigger object, spin the board more times in a kick flip, or get a higher air on a vert ramp, the modern “scientist” is usually trying to demonstrate some sort of epically extreme “trick” with a better score than their predecessor. In the case of quantum information “science”, this means longer coherence time qubits, better control, more gates, scaling up the systems, etc.  As in any extreme sport, you get points for style: even if your coherence time is not much better than other groups, if you do it in some super macho bad ass way, you still get props at the conferences, which lead back to more money and respect.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if I just want to build a microprocessor out of mud and soot?  My background in solid state physics should set me up for that. It appears that it should be doable.  Even if it’s huge and slow, doing fab without the current fab infrastructure would be huge for society, and it’s frankly more scientifically interesting to study dirt and soot than some fancy bullshit. But that’s not “serious”.  If you study what is effectively dirt, but do it in a way with a lot of expensive equipment and trendy materials(e.g. graphene!) it’s called science and you can still play with the big kids.  But if you simply grab some random dirt and start playing with it and measuring it with a 20 dollar Arduino board, you’ve gone rogue, become a kook.  And theory is even worse.  Theorists not only have no interest in helping society solve real problems or studying the world around them in a way that might possibly be related to curiosity, they won’t even help experimentalists solve problems that would get money and power if they were solved in the applied or experimental parts of science.  They can only work on stuff that’s so obscure that only another theorist can do it, because that’s how you get money and power within theory.  So inevitably this leads to a sort of academic wankery event horizon where at the worst you have string theorists totally disconnected from any kind of reality or experiment or society at large, doing useless math no one but them can understand and expecting the rest of the world to take them seriously as the purveyors of the Ultimate Truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "I’m going to cut this short now and do something else, but in short here is what I’ve come to believe.  Science as a world view and science as an institution act like a religion, is less useful all the time, is not fun to do, is a net negative for society, and generally is just a huge bummer.  I’m not sure what to call this thing I’m trying to do now, but it’s not that.  Fuck science.\n"

If your technology needs the techno priests to function, it means your technology sucks and needs to be replaced.   If it needs extraction of raw materials from the earth or any control over large tracts of land in a centralized way to function it is bad technology and needs to be replaced.  If it requires secrecy or proprietary control of information and use it is bad technology.  If it can’t function without capitalism it is bad technology and needs to be replaced.\n",

That is, two drive coils and two magnets, along orthogonal axes, are coupled and driven so that they can make a central mass move in a clockwise or counterclockwise orbit, but with no net rotation–this basically works.  And I can see how to scale it up, scale it down, run it with a bigger or smaller mass etc.  But what to do first? what are the priorities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some choices:\n",

    "•\tfocus on fulcrum design: gimbal?  silicone blob?  springs built into it?\n",

    " \n",
    "I’m going to do all of these eventually.  But on writing them down it’s clear what’s next.  The demo I have doesn’t really function for anything useful and is not repeatable enough to warrant distribution.\n",
    "1.\tMaking some kind of crude lever arm setup, even if it’s huge and weird is clearly the priority.  Build a CLEAN and REPEATABLE circular trajectory that can be easily reversed, where the lengths of both sides can be adjusted to adjust impedance, mass can be added or subtracted, rotation is avoided, and the diameter of the circle trajectory is over 1 cm, speed slow enough to see clearly, force enough to drive a crank around and make a shaft turn.   All that.  That must be done, all demos flow from that.\n",
    "2.\tAlso: modularity!  I need to have a fixed setup with both drive coils and sense coils and the electronics all integrated so as to always work for a circular drive, including on found objects like door stops and sticks.  With that built, separate from that, I can have a board in the skeletron system that has the rods, masses, magnets, fulcrum.\n",
    "3.\tA first step is to make the magnet holding mass that lives on the end of a 4 mm aluminum rod.  So I need to bake a sculpey cube with a aluminum shaft in it as well as nuts which will all be JB welded in after baking, and the magnets fit onto the clay and stick to the nuts.\n",
    "4.\tWith this rod with magnets and mass finished, dig out existing silicone fulcrum and find a way to fix that to a modular board(stick-board not PCB).  Then string up bolts to connect rubber bands to just short of the mass/magnets.\n",
    "5.\tTHEN, when all this is put together, choose locations for both sense coils so that x and y are both MEASURED.  Fix in place in simple repeatable location.  Probably right under each coil is best, it captures x and y in the simplest most repeatable way.\n",
    "6.\tWhen coils are in place and full level arm is in place, clamp them together, clamp them to the desk, and then add a knob to the PCB being used. Then start experimenting with the code, having it measure theta in various ways while spinning the thing around manually. Also make a simple dumb drive where the knob determines frequency and the two coils are each doing about 120 degrees of push and the knob just sets the frequency.\n",
    "7.\tAfter all these experiments, think hard about the math and re write a very simple version of the code with feedback.\n",
    "8.\tThen test, mess with all components, re-test.\n",

Conversely the kind of person who wants to discourse on history of trains for half an hour at the bus stop or sell a obviously stolen hammer for a slice of pizza instantly picks me out of a crowd to talk to.  That’s fine with me, I’d rather buy a hammer(I still have that hammer, bought in Berkeley in the mid 90s) or hear about trains than talk to anyone remotely normal.  The thing about this is sometimes it opens up amazing stories from people who are odd but not actually kooks. Today was one of those days, and boy howdy did I learn some things!\n",

    "The person who started talking to me initially was a middle aged guy who looked like a sort of hippie college professor type.  He saw that I had the book Command and Control by Eric Schlosser, and asked about it because he read Fast Food Nation, also by Schlosser.  But as I talked about plutonium and nuclear weapons his wife got involved and that’s where things got interesting.  She graduated first in her class from Moscow State in chemical engineering back in the Soviet days, then worked in oil and gas in Turkmenistan for 10 years during a time that overlapped the collapse of the USSR.

I saw with my own eyes as a massive amount of nuclear expertise went over the border to Iran.  I can name the scientists, who did that, who moved the materials, no one cared”.  I mentioned anecdotes I heard in grad school from the grapevine about Americans sent over to the Soviet bloc with suitcases filled with 100 dollar bills to distribute to scientists to prevent them getting up to any nuclear mischief for lack of money since the Soviet government had stopped being able to pay salaries.  She snorted at this, and said “not everyone is motivated by money.  You think scientists are motivated by money?  Stalin locked up half of them, and even for free, in the gulags, they would keep working.  Why?  Because they can’t stop, they want to use their minds.”  True.  All true.\n",

She’s given up oil and gas engineering because they are evil(I got confused by her accent but she said something about consumption destroying the world), and now raises rabbits for a living here in central Denver, the hair of which makes amazing hats apparently.  But another thing the rabbits do is die quickly when exposed to plutonium or uranium.  Faster than humans, which makes them a very good indicator that things are about to get bad.  I was glad to hear her Denver rabbits are quite healthy.  However the word on the street among rabbit people is a good source of data on actinide issues elsewhere.  Apparently Ft. Collins, CO has bad water, with uranium in it from a local nuclear weapons related facility.  She said the feds have assured people it’s all ok but that this is all bullshit and is based on flawed models of how heavy metals move through the earth.  In official models, they’re assumed to follow liquid water, which in turn follows gravity.  Heavy metals in general do neither of these things, they follow gradients in chemical potential which can be uphill just as easily as downhill, and are essentially impossible to predict.  So once you know uranium is in the ground water you’re not going to know where it goes next until someone’s bunnies die.  She took this seriously enough to forbid her daughter from going to Colorado State University in Ft. Collins due to the threat of uranium poisoning.  I’ve read and seen enough of how feds are around nuclear materials to find all this 100% credible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, why does she know so much about uranium when she worked on oil and gas?  Well it turns out if you were part of the technical elite in the USSR one of the things you had to do was a weekly study group on nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.  They had what looked like a house to be “subtle” which they all went into every week and got an ongoing survey of details on engineering of all the most horrifying weapons ever conceived.  Good times. And for the record she agrees with my position that the only way to be safe with nuclear weapons is to eliminate them completely from all nations, no exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "I asked her if she has a Geiger counter at home.  Her view is that for safety from things like uranium or plutonium in the ground water, Geiger counters are of little use and she doesn’t have one.  Basically by the time you hear a click on the counter, you’re already fucked if it’s long term exposure to heavy metals you’re worried about.  Still, regardless of what she says about that particular poison I tend to think that in the future there will be a lot more radiation detectors around as well as, hopefully, cheap mass spectrometers so we can verify “clean” soil and water.

First of all, I just finished a book about US involvement in Asia from the turn of the last century through the end of WWII, which was fascinating, called Empires on the Pacific.  Also, unrelated, I saw a news story about the owner of a plumbing shop in Texas who’s suing a car dealer because he saw his logo on a truck used by ISIS on the TV.  Apparently the truck somehow made it from Texas to the middle east and was acquired by ISIS.\n",
    "\n",
    "What struck me about this story is that reading about the conflict of various imperial powers during WWII, supply lines were always one of the biggest issues for all parties involved.  The Americans, British, Germans, Russians and Japanese were all competing for very specific raw materials like rubber, oil, and various metals.  These are very specific demands.  The war machine of each major power individually needed  a supply line of rubber from the plantation to the jeep factory if they wanted rubber tires on their jeeps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not so now.  Anyone with money can get anything now, almost immediately.  Does ISIS have some supply chain of rubber, steel, copper, silver, and gold to make trucks?  No.  Just oil.  With oil they can get money and with money they can get anything.  From anywhere.  And it’s not that they wanted a truck from Texas, they just didn’t care and neither did the global market.  Was the truck American and made in Mexico or Japanese and made in Georgia?  Were the parts made in China or Eastern Europe?  Who knows? Who cares?\n",
    "\n",
    "The world of the modern supply chain is almost unbelievably different now than it was half a century ago.  I believe that this is a fundamental shift that government and corporate structures have not yet caught up with.  If rubber, steel, plastic, copper, silver, gold, aluminum, glass, etc. are all everywhere and moving around the world all the time, the assumptions that industrial empires have been based on in the past fall apart.  Corporate and state structure have a lot to do with economies of scale.  In the age of industrial empires nations the size of the USSR or USA and companies the size of IBM or Dow win over their smaller rivals due in large part to economies of scale.  I claim that those economies of scale are worth way less in today’s world than they were.\n",
    "\n",
    "I realize this is nothing new and has been said better many times and with more facts to back it up.  But it’s relevant for my project because it relates to how I want to recast the supply chain problem.  I believe that if we are to have a brighter future or in fact any future at all it will be by abandoning  the economies of scale of past empires and building with what is on hand, which was extracted and refined by the old system.  Humanity used to have to make do with what was available, which often meant not getting what we needed.  There is no reason that this would be true in a post industrial future, however, since the last 300 years have already extracted enough to live on forever.  That is the goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, it’s a bit horrifying to think how unstable this could all end up.  If industrial empires really are obsolete, what replaces them can be very very good in some cases, but very very bad in others.  The way for the good to triumph is to build a system that easily absorbs more people rather than rejecting them as our current systems do.  Everyone in major industrial empires agrees adding population due to refugees will create economic hardships because it will mean more people competing for available jobs.  But this is totally irrational.  Surely we need a lot of work done, just look around at all the important stuff we supposedly don’t have resources for.  The system that wins will be the one that moves beyond the industrial empires and can absorb the refugees from the decentralized evils like ISIS in such a way as to smoothly grow.  No one wants to live under ISIS or work a shitty minimum wage job in capitalist America.  People do both because they have no choice.  If supply chains were short enough that you only need to get 50 people together to build a functioning industrial society,most people would go that route given the choice.  We just need to show the way and people will follow.\n",

    "# My story with plutonium \n",
    "\n",
    "I’ve never really written down the whole story of what happened, and now that I have a proper blog is as good as any time to write it all down.\n",
    "\n",
    "On June 9, 2008 I was at a conference at a nearby city(Broomfield, CO, a 25 minutes drive) for the day instead of at work.  My memory is hazy now but throughout the week I was dropping by work for an hour or two here and there after the conference so I was around and hearing things but not actually on site all day.  I remember being on campus and hearing something about a “plutonium spill”.  This was said casually as if it’s  not that big a deal.  What the fuck?  Doesn’t that mean we evacuate?  No alarm sounded.  I check my official work email.  Nothing.  hours pass, and some rumors go by.  I forget the exact time line here but I definitely remember standing by the front door and seeing people with Geiger counters in the hall.  We asked what was going on, and the management was very casual.\n",
    "\n",
    "If I remember right, the NEXT day, this bullshit was still going on, and this is where it gets much worse.  No evacuation, no real quarantine was formed.  College undergrads who were doing a summer internship were “volunteered” to use Geiger counters and paper towels(!) to clean up “hot” spots along the long tiled hallway.  Me and my boss both screamed bloody murder about this, and the managers didn’t even see why we were upset.  Ultimately the undergrads heard enough lies over that day from management that they all just holed up in the conference room refusing to do any work.  We told them to just leave and not come back until they hear on the news that the site is safe and to not trust NIST management about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "What came out over the next days weeks and months was that through ought this period the lawyers who work for NIST back in Maryland(none of whom got fired over this) were instructing management specifically to keep the information both from the public(even after it was known the lab was sending plutonium down the drain into the city waste water), the press, and staff(at least officially).  For at least the first 3 days or so no official communication happened from management.  One middle manager lied to my face on the first day or two saying that “email was down” which obviously it wasn’t, as we all used the same .gov email the rest of us were sending and getting email the whole time(including the usual spam from managers) .\n",
    "\n",
    "We also found out later that as soon as a spill was known to have happened, collaborators on the project from one of the DOE nuclear weapons labs offered to drive up immediately and take over the cleanup.  Our managers TURNED THAT DOWN.  That’s right, when offered the chance to allow competent personnel from the kind of lab that can turn plutonium on a lathe to completely take responsibility for the spill, managers decided that they would choose to interpret “spin control” to mean “ask a bunch of college kids to clean up a nuclear accident with paper towels”.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why it’s hard to take seriously 911 conspiracy theorists(well, one of many reasons).  Among the truthers’ many odd theories is that NIST management was part of what would surely be the vastest secret the government has ever kept from the American people and press.   Now I watched in real time these same managers fail to keep a conspiracy of only local proportions secret from the DAILY CAMERA, Boulder’s local paper.  If you’re not familiar with Boulder, this is the same level of shit kicker local booster newspaper you’d expect in any town of about 100,000 yuppie dick heads.   Not exactly Woodward and Bernstein here.  This vast conspiracy lasted all of about 4 hours.  So I’m pretty sure the same bunch of morons did not fake all the data on melted steel beams or whatever and keep it secret for 14 years.  But I digress.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next step was for management to go into full defense mode.  Many huge “mandatory all hands meetings” were had.  Ultimately it was decided that “safety culture” needed to be boosted, one radiation safety officer was fired, the lowly temp worker post doc who actually spilled the stuff was fired, various mangers were shifted around in ways that didn’t affect their status or pay, just moved them away from the blame areas, and we had a ton more rules.  Much as 911 gave every shit head fascist in America an excuse to push all their toxic shit, every shit head bureaucrat in our management chain who wanted to prevent useful work from getting done took this as a chance to make life worse without actually making it safer.  Many more months of meetings followed where we heard all about “safety culture”, as well as “safety stand downs”(whatever the fuck that means).  We all had to work on making huge word documents for “standard operating procedures”, which was just busy work that ended up with a bunch of managers standing around assessing the minor safety issues that were easily fixable, and then re-justifying all the decisions that had been made based on cost or hassle the first time.\n",
    "\n",
    "I was never a huge fan of NIST management but this was a real line in the sand for me.  I lost a lot of respect for several colleagues who banded together with management to circle the institutional wagons and make sure no one was held responsible for the safety disaster.  As I talked with people familiar with the Rocky Flats nuclear incidents that had happened in a nearby Colorado town, and read more about Chernobyl and other nuclear incidents, I saw more and more the same story.  Surely no one but a very rigidly controlled organization can responsibly deal with nuclear materials–but those very organizations have fundamental flaws that will ALWAYS lead to this type of incident when materials like plutonium are handled.\n",
    "\n",
    "I need to add a bit of background, as I’ve skipped a lot of technical details: What, exactly happened?\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the labs in the same division I was in was working on very sensitive detectors of nuclear radiation.  Perhaps somewhat ironically the main applications are nuclear security: making the big machine that UN inspectors can wheel up to the reactor in a  “rogue state” to detect compliance with anti proliferation agreements.  Rather than build detectors and ship them to a weapons lab for testing(as I mentioned before they had collaborators set up to do this already), they decided the detectors should be tested in house. And for some reason that the right material for this was powdered plutonium.   I italicize that because that was one of the many very bad decisions that were key turning points: had the sample been potted in some sort of epoxy this incident never would have happened.  The powdered sample was then encased not in a welded stainless steel canister but(again for reasons that were never clear) in a fucking GLASS VIAL.  Yes, a highly toxic material that standard practice and common sense would dictate are sealed in welded steel was in a tiny thing glass tube, fused at the end(if you’ve done any scientific glass blowing this is the first crude thing you learn to do).\n",
    "\n",
    "Ah, but it gets better.  They had “double containment”, which  I shit you not, was TWO ZIP LOCK FUCKING BAGS. Ok, that’s not ideal, but maybe the bags might hold the plutonium powder in if the tube broke?  Not if you use duct tape to attach the bags to the bottom of the detectors, and then repeatedly stick and un-stick the duct tape.  In the war between a sandwich bag and a roll of duct tape, the tape will win every time.  So yes, the glass broke, and the bags leaked, and the guy using them then washed off in the sink(which drains to the city sewer), walked his now-radioactive shoes down the hall, over to the urinal in the mens room, then to the sink where he washed more plutonium down a second sink.   He then told someone in his lab, and the rumor and spin process began in earnest.  In the mean time, however, yet another egregious safety problem was that the main plutonium work area was near the front door of a very large multi-use lab that has a wire bonder near the back.  About 25-50 people had access to that machine, with probably as many as a dozen using it often.  Among the people exposed were a number of researchers in other parts of the org chart who, not knowing anything was up, walked in and out using that machine while the plutonium was already all over the place.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, no one was (apparently) exposed at a high enough dose to (probably) affect their life expectancy significantly.   So that’s good. But this was not due to anything that management did, it’s just the limited size of the plutonium sample and a ton of blind luck that this wasn’t much worse.  What is clear to me, however is that management literally could not have acted much worse if they’d tried.  To me the idea that this should end careers was obvious, but the only question was whether there would be criminal liability.  But that wasn’t even mentioned ever.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, I should note that the chain of negligent management went all the way to the very top of the org chart.  The director definitely knew that this had happened during the period where management was covering this up and not evacuating.\n",
    "\n",
    "I was fucking pissed this whole time, and raised a bit of hell as I was able. The first thing I did was call the Nuclear Regulatory Commission whistle blower hotline.  Due to a paranoia that now feels very silly, I did this from a payphone and didn’t give them my name, and I’m pretty sure that went nowhere.  NRC was, in my view, as guilty as our management because they had to sign off on NIST having the license to get the plutonium in the first place which clearly never should have happened based on staff’s ignorance of nuclear safety.  My next call was to the office of our local representative at the time, Marc Udall.  Since then he moved up from the house to the senate, then lost that seat recently, but at that time he was the local rep from our area and lived pretty close to our lab.  The staffer I talked to on the phone was familiar with the case, and promised to forward my information, which was this: “the main way management is culpable is in failure to notify staff in a timely manner, ask the NIST director about that.”\n",
    "\n",
    "A couple days later, the committee in congress that was investigating the incident came up on CSPAN and I was pumped to see if some democracy stuff was going to happen, so I tuned in.  And my elected representative, to his credit, actually asked my question!  Woo! Democracy!\n",
    "\n",
    "…and was promptly stone walled.  I can’t even remember the content of gibberish  that the director spouted off to the committee but it sure as hell was not an answer.  So then, a gavel was banged, congressmen agitatedly stood up and demanded that he answer or face charges for contempt of congress!!!!! Just kidding.  When faced by yet another executive branch official blatantly stone walling a congressional inquiry, every single person in the room just let it slide and moved on.  No blame was placed at the upper levels, everyone with power kept their jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s about the end of my story.  My take home was that middle management behaves badly not because three mile island, the fukushima plant and Chernobyl all happened to be run by unusually bad people, but because a giant bureaucracy that runs a nuclear site will always behave badly in a similar way for reasons that are pretty fundamental and will not change, probably ever.\n"

    "# Transistors etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to have the feedback I want for this motor, I need some form of transistor.  Right now I’m using FETs, which cost a few cents.  More specifically I use the  IRLML0060TRPBF which go from $0.50 for one to down to about $0.16 in bulk at least from digikey, so probably well under 10 cents buying from China directly.  So in terms of the bill of materials cost it’s basically ok for now, but this is really not ideal for the overall long term plan.  I want zero money involved in the production, and I know of no way to get transistors in bulk without money or a fab facility at this time.\n",
    "\n",
    "My plan has always been to harvest electronics from trash, hopefully from old smashed up cars.  But I don’t like the scalability of this for transistors. A car definitely has some transistors in it, but the labor involved in getting  them out and the number per car are such that I think it will never compete with scrounging up some money and buying them.  Microprocessors are a different story, but I think for transistors scavenging them as discrete components is unlikely to be cost effective in most cases.  Older electronics might have enough that it makes sense, but the failure rate and lousy characteristics may also make that not worth it.\n",
    "\n",
    "So where does that leave me?  I’m really not ok with buying transistors, but I need transistors.  I could use something electromechanical, the way brushed DC motors do, effectively making a mechanical transistor(also known as a switch) with the brushes.  But that has obvious drawbacks I want to avoid involving wearing and precision.  So I think what this all points to is fabrication.  I have to actually get into fabrication.  I have about 12 years of microfabrication experience, and my phd involved some pretty hard fab, so it’s hardly surprising that I’m ending up here.\n",
    "\n",
    "What does that mean?  Am I going to go buy a mask aligner, RIE, sputter machines, etc?  No. Actually, HELL no.  What I want is fabrication technology targeting discrete transistors which can be made with no special tools from trash.  I know that sounds crazy but I don’t believe it is. Essentially I think some form of organic electronics will be able to satisfy this.  I think it should be possible using compounds found in the waste streams I’m using anyway to get the kinds of behavior I need for an FET.  I’ve been looking through the literature and asking friends over the last few months, and it’s clear that this problem is not being worked on in the way I want to because my figures of merit are different.  To people working in the capitalist economy, billion dollar fab lines are already sunk cost.  If you design a new part that uses the existing fab line, or better yet one a couple generations back, the added cost for another transistor is close to zero.  So you only veer off from that when you get something OTHER than cost or simplicity in return: ultra low noise, low power consumption, speed, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically what I want is fab from soot.  Soot is everywhere.  We breathe it and it sucks.  But what is in soot is a incredible zoo of interesting carbon structures.  Bucky horns, onions, tubes, sheets, etc. have all been seen.  I remember seeing a somewhat alarming thesis years ago from MIT where the student had taken images of the soot found on the roof of the building in Cambridge.  Basically every weird looking carbon shape in the literature is right there in the air every Bostonian breathes(someone in Beijing should repeat this for even more horrifying results).  Also, soot should have all too many polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.  Found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycyclic_aromatic_hydrocarbon\n",

    "Although it’s been almost 15 years since I was in the carbon nanotechnology world, I’ve been trying to keep an eye on that stuff over the years, and from what I can tell the nanotube and graphene stuff remains pretty bad.  On the other hand, the organic electronics work with smaller fragments of graphite, with various other atoms around on the edges(e.g. PAH’s), seem to be actually turning into technology.  I’ve been trying to dig into that literature to some very limited extent and I think that’s where this will go.  To do that I’ll probably need both a chemist and a transport expert as collaborators.  But I’m pretty sure this is where my research is going to end up.  It involves all the threads I’ve worked on in my physics career and I really do need it for the motor to be really free.\n",

    "\n",
    "Here I’ll do a brief overview of how I make my coils. This is not a real tutorial since a bunch of details are pretty sparse and you still need a 3d printer and some files and details on that, but it shows where the process stands now.  I’m discussing drive coils here, and will describe the sense coils elsewhere(those are 30 AWG).  Drive coils are always 24 AWG, with some kind of varnish type insulation like polyamide.  Here is a 1 pound spool of the stuff I bought off Amazon:\n",
    " \n",
    "Notice that it’s on a stick which goes through my desk so that the spool can spin freely during the winding.The driver for the winding is a pair of 3d printed parts clamped in the drill motor like this:\n",
    " \n",
    "The parts for the spool mold are shown here, both 3d printed on my Dremel printer:\n",
    " \n",
    "Notice the matching keyway between these halves and the part that clamps in the drill.  Also, there are 4 holes that go through both of these parts so that they can be wired together.  The wires used to hold them together are of the same type: 24 AWG copper with or without insulation:\n",
    " \n",
    "Wires are pulled tight with a pair of pliers and then twisted together to fasten the halves with a little bit of force:\n",
    " \n",
    "This is the other side, note two wires are used not four or one:\n",
    " \n",
    "Now another two wires are used to lay down the basis of the wires that will hold the coil together.  These are fed through the slots and bent around in some way to keep them in position while the col winding gets started.  This picture shows the wires in position but not yet wound out of the way:\n",
    " \n",
    "And here both are threaded into all four slots and wound around to get them out of the way:\n",
    " Once that’s all tidy, the whole thing is put on the key that is clamped in the drill motor:\n",
    " \n",
    "You then run the drill with one hand and feed the wire with the other to get an even coil of wire that fills up the space in the mold like this:\n",
    " \n",
    "Now those special wires that went under the whole coil come into play.  You pull them out and cut each one in half, so that there are four evenly placed longish wires going under the coil at the four slots.\n",
    " \n",
    "Then you wrap them around the coil and wind it tight with a pliers, bend the twisted part over and cut it off.  Then cut the wires that hold the halves together. Once this is done nothing holds the plastic parts together and they should both easily come apart like this:\n",
    " \n",
    "With that done the coil is done except for stripping the insulation off the end with a x-acto knife and soldering a 0.100″ header on like this:\n",

    "What do I mean when I say \"computer\"? What does anyone mean?  Historically, a computer is a thing that Mostly what we actually want \"computer tech\" for is not computation at all. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us for a moment ignore how computers work at the physical level today and look at what user experience they create that is most useful.  Mostly what we want \"computers\" for today is communication of various kinds.  We want to communicate with people, and with various sources of data aggregated from people as well as from physical data.  The \"data\" people create is mostly movements and interactions with various objects that exist on the disply.  \n",
    "\n",
    "What would be a reasonable ab initio approach to solving this problem with free hardware? What might such a system look like?  First of all, it should not need to do anything when no events are happening and it's not being reprogrammed.  By default it should have a visible display that can sit indefinitely without needing any energy or information to travel anywhere.  And as things happen it should only power up as needed for that actual thing to happen. For example, if a user moves their hand along a touch sensitive display to drag an icon they see on the screen, and all that does is change the position of the icon, then all that should physically happen is that the pixels change to move where the icon is displayed.  If a tap on the icon is detected, the computational ability should exist IN THE DISPLAY to start the event that should happen when that icon gets touched.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Integral parts of our technology are fractal plumbing in thermoplastics which can carry liquids, high voltages and high current, so the display and response will all be built into that.  This can mean various inks and dies are pumped around in pixels, pools, lines, etc.  There is no reason to be restricted to pixels on a grid, given the fact that everything can be edited after the fact and can be custom for whatever system is being run. Pressure sensors and capacitor sensors can both be used for touch sensitivity, which physically computes with various capacitor charges, moving liquids, etc to make events happen.  What events? Physical events, everything is physical: icons, programs, files, directories, sensors, displays.  \n",

    "This whole picture is much more physical than the computer of today.  And not surprisingly it's much less heirerarchial. I believe that today's computers represent the deep underlying philosophical and religious beliefs of their creators.  The ONE clock that the whole processor runs off is a representation of the One God of monotheism.  The belief in a all powerful source of authority from which all authority descends along a long, uniform, rigid heirarchy is at the heart of the type of protestantism that spawned the industrial revolution which led through continuous innovation to the computer revolution.  I argue that the creators of technology have been in such a rush since the begining of the protestant military capitalist empires that no one has had time to catch their breath and think things through, and that if we did we'd end up with some much better technology.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This clock talk may sound like paranoid ramblings, but it's not just abstract religious philosophy, it's very much practical applied natural philosophy.  I want technology that doesn't do anything unless an event happens, like a finger tap on a screen or high wind detected that a drone needs to rise into the air to grab energy from.  So each event should have its own clock.  Clocks are replaced by transients. The whole way computations happen is propagation of event signals along various electrical and fluid channels.  This also means it's easy for information to flow along diverse channels.  This type of computation thus does not distinguish between materials, energy, and information.  Information is physical and all physical objects are information.  \n",

Note also that with software and hardware no longer separated and with \"compuation\"(a term that should be made obsolete by dissolving the artificial barriers between computation and other physical processes) always focused on a specific application, that programmers/users don't need to learn a general language anymore.  From what I can tell this follows the path of mainstream software today: the gmail API is a sepearte thing from a language, and is more important for writing a useful program than knowing java or C or whatever.  If you specialize in building shitter pipes, you will know all the ins and outs of biological fluid computation/processing to use different types of microorganism to break down waste and turn it into valueable materials, then package those materials into products to be used(mostly fertilizer for growing more food and other materials.)  You won't need to be an expert on displays, just know enough to get your display to interact with the shitter pipe compilers.  This display will be optimized for working in waste collection areas, while wearing gloves.  \n",

    "Visualization of data should be physical.  Right now analog information gets digitized, various digital computations happen to the numbers, then a graph is sent to a display.  I imagine most data visualization in our system to be much more direct.  Hardware is coded in such a way, for instance, that a physical variable as a function of time for one second after a button press is shown as a line plot on a screen.  That is a physical connection: the position of some colored fluids just below a transparrent surface of the display is physically determined by the variable.  Almost all programming ends up being a series of transducer events, where one type of physical information is turned into another.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Most of what we actually *want* computers to do does not require speed or complicated math.  With various exceptions we mostly give up on both of these, and suddenly building computers which can be used by the masses for their actual needs out of junk cars, sticks, mud and poop, sounds much easier.  Many \"computers\" will run very slowly, and have very few events.  A slow and simple stream of information might flow from the world to the Machine in the form of occasional flooding of a low lying bit of land that drains through a energy catch.  That energy is then used to do a scout mission of the area for new trash to collect.  If good stuff is found, energy gets saved up for as long as it takes, and freight is put on a long range courier droid that starts slowly off in some direction set by its code, getting energy as it finds it(event driven physical compuations happend when energy is found), and eventually ends up getting reused in the population center where it ends, starting a event for a human to send a signal to reprogram the remote droid base or not.  A computer will look a lot more like a tree, and indeed it will often make sense for large parts of a computer to be alive.  In a fluid computer, simple things like snails for cleaning can be very useful at setting up a working process. \n",

    "And of course if everthing we do is seen as a type of physical computation this must also include growing food.  The distinction between some sort of food growing pod that gets nutrients from material lines and \"computation\" in terms of looking at data or whatever will dissolve.  A lot of math that happens now, not just with money but with all kinds of measuremetns will dissappear, replaced by direct physical graphical computation.  \n",

    "I want to take a look at how physical computing applies to robots.  Consider a robot that is designed to carry small payloads up a small stream.  The stream is not navigable for a boat, and is just a few inches deep and a few feet wide.  But it goes for many miles, and it's easy for a hopping rolling or walking machine to move along the land next to the stream.  A robot like this has a physical program that after a start event on water configures itself to sit on the bank and spin in the current until a capacitor is charged.  On event of full charging, it will roll itself uphill or downhill, with sensors physically programmed to guide it along the creek.  If both stuck and lost, it can call for help and have clearly displayed zero energy instructions on how someone can drag it back to a creek and what its mission is.  The octohedral rolling droid might be a form factor for the body of this kind of robot. This thing moves slowly, and doesn't do very many things.  With the right hardware components it's easy for a novice to assemble the *hardware* which makes this behave as if it has the right software.  Because the whole things is free, and simple, and easy to make using the same technology this csn be scaled way up, making a constant flow of robots up and down the stream moving small parts around.  One scenario might be to have a rumble of them head up or down stream to anohter settlement to distribute coils, magnets, or other small elements to build up the trash wizard technology over time in new places.  This might be a sort of seed pod for the philosophy engine, where the rolling droid has the book encoded on it, and maybe in some cases a proper bound hard cover, but it can also be summmoned by a reader of The Book who joins a value circle and is mastering trash wizardry from scratch.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This whole scenario, duplicated and mutated over and over, is how anarchist infrastructure is built up.  There no longer are any \"computers\" or \"software\", or \"robots\".  There is just technology and life, which are intermingled, and which process information energy and materials all as flows through itself, modified by physical programs edited by humans controlling displays that control physical matter. \n",

The instinct to go a certain direction based on navigating off of the sun is programmed  into the physical hardware.  After some long time, maybe many years, the machine calls for help, eventually someone finds it and follows the instructions for repair and improvement.  With generation after generation editing and helping the thing exist, it can exist for hundreds of years, slowly cleaning up wasted sacrafice zones of the old capitalist world.  \n",

The very fact that land can have negative value, that this is a concept that people accept, should be yet another red flag that assignment of numerical values to real human values is a morally bankrupt act.  \n",

There is light, various machines, transportation, communication, medicine, refrigeration and heating of food, growing of food, and of course heat and air conditioning.  These last two can easily eat up vast portions of your energy budget, dominating everything else and make apparently relatively similar lifestyles drastically different in energy foot print with no difference in quality of life(air conditioning a house with shade trees and good ventilation vs. neither of those). \n",
    "\n",
    "Peoeple should, I believe, always try to live with a strong thermal link to a opposing heat sink.  As the climate heats up and the oceans swallow the coastal cities, which get reclaimed by trash wizardry, the obvious heat sink is the cool water of the ocean.  Perhaps it's not that cool, and it depends on where you live, but there are a lot of heavily populated areas where even as both ocean temperatures and air temperatures rise, the water will continue to be so much cooler than the air that it can be a fantastic heat sink.  With green shade canopy grown from purified ocean water and housing connected to deep water heat sinks, only some movement of air and water will be needed to regulate a comfortable temperature.  With this massive amount of water surface area, additional cooling power from pumping on water(pumps driven by electricity from currents and waves and wind and sun) to evaporate it can augment this to create a ambient energy driven system that gives comfortable temperatures inside and in many cases with microclimates \"outside\" that are cooler than the outside air.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Very cold climates can get thermal help by digging down.  NOt everywhere has geothermal that is a useful source of energy in the traditional sense, but even a heat sink at 55 degrees F could be a huge resource in a region with -40 degrees F above ground.  This combination of temperatures is true in many places people live in the north.  If good, well regulated thermal links are provided between dwellings and warmer underground spaces, getting up to 50 degrees F should be \"free\", and all that is needed is to warm another 15 or 20 degrees F, easily accomplished with direct solar heat and wind-electric heat.\n",

So the two 400:1 transformers transform the AC voltage by the square of 400 or 40,000X.  If you get a volt or so at the input coil, this should produce 10's of kV on the output coil.  A pair of diodes then dump the charge into two different capacitors, one for the plus and one for the minus, or 4 diodes give a bridge rectifier.  \n",

By producing O2 and H2 in the lower voltage electrolysis cell, these gasses can be flowed through various low pressure cells, which can have high voltage discharges, showing various plasma physics.  This would be a VERY high impact demonstration of several things: use of ambient energy, plasma physics from scratch, creation of clean water from ambient energy, cool zap effects that can be construed as \"art\", and demonstration of energy storage.  \n",

The needed energy is always a margin less than what the cap has, but in an emergency, a rescue unit will drag a dead sky hook unit to the next station.  At each station, the high voltage capacitor is physically handed off to the local robot that hooks that up to the ambient charging station and instantly hands off a fully charged capacitor to the passing cart.  Thus it can go indefinitely by grabbing capacitors and dropping them off at each station, as long as cars pass infrequently relative to the charging time of a capacitor.  With infrequent travel times, say once or twice a day for some minor frieght needs, getting that energy over several hours is trivial even with tiny available energy that is very uneven in available load. \n",

Usually this term is used by various conspiracy nuts to describe ways of \"getting energy for free\" from something like the zero point quantum energy or the Earth's magnetic field.  Both of these are nonsense, as are all the free energy schemes presented throughout youtube and the rest of the Internet.  \n",

    "No, we are told, energy is not \"free\".  It has to COME from somewhere.  But this notion is based on a capitalist world view.  Energy is deemed \"free\" if you don't have to get it from a mine and labor.  Renewable energy is not free: much labor is expended to build the infrastructure out of mined minerals which have a finite lifetime and eventually go to landfill to be replaced by more mining and labor.  \n",
    "\n",
    "But if free energy is energy that can be useful but is not derived from mining and labor, then free energy can and does exist.  Energy not spent on air conditioning when you build under a shade tree is free energy.  Energy from the sun that warms through your front window is free energy.  And the electrical energy stored in salvaged rebuildable capacitors from salvaged rebuildable robots storing ambient energy is free. \n",

But if it does the equivalent of even just a few hundred hours of human labor it has a net negative cost in labor-value.  In terms of minerals if it is built from minerals that were polluting the world around us, the mineral cost is negative: as opposed to subtracting value from the land as mining does it adds value to the land.  And finally the energy of the technology must be free in the sense that it absorbs from something unwanted elsewhere.  \n",
