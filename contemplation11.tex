\subsection{Eleventh Contemplation: Bathtub
Life}\label{eleventh-contemplation-bathtub-life}

Color this in in the tub. I would recommend playing Credence very loud
at this point. Just sit back and stare at the tub in the tub and
contemplate a future that centers on this. Surely this is what we should
strive for? Sitting here in the tub with a coloring book and relaxing
should be the focus of the future.
