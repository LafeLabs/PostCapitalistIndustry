This section should have some basic assembly plans and information to get started even without the second volume.  

Things to make here:

- vibrational oscillator with musical pickup
- 3d input device
- 3d manipulator, linked to input device
- wood cutting for circuits techniques
- plastic welding techniques
- waterwheel generator to 5V USB charger
- skeletron guide, with pictures, cartoons, detailed instructions, several plans:
	- tent
	- water wheel
	- tripod for manipulator and probe
	- vibrational musical instrument
	- boat
- high voltage generator
- strobe microscope
- LED art vibrator display
- basic electrochemical probe
- temperature regulator with hoist and thermometer and fire
- ambient art pieces powered off water and wind that use electricity to do things which can be repaired forever by anyone and moved and rebuilt and replaced by anyone
- vibrator with polished stones as massager
- Josephson junction pendulum
- build a heated shit reactor with a giant tube and air pump to send gasses to the top of a tree


### circuits:
 - generic vibrational feedback drive
 - magnetic pickup to audio output for music
 - stepper motor driven by potentiometer so knob goes to wheel directly with one Arduino per motor+knob combo--three of these and two tripods is the standard manipulation space for a generic tool
 - strobe with trigger and 555 delay and knob to tune delay, can be used for microscopy with vibrational drive of water position, control of phase delay can control focus electronically with no mechanical focus knob needed 
 - POV on vibrational object to make 2d image
 - power supply circuit that turns output of AC generator coil into 5V regulated power
 - step up board that charges a 50 V capacitor from AC generator coil input
 - stepper driven by two digital inputs and two buttons for one direction and the other, with feedback coils for free running operation at variable torque
 - electrochemical probe with audio output for conductance based on an RC oscillator and LED array to show average voltage, two joysticks to control the average voltage and the amplitude of the oscillation(with feedback): one micro controller, one neopixel array, a speaker with transistor drive, two joysticks, various connections with different capacitors and different wires and possible probes
 - digital thermometer with serial bluetooth readout and up/down digital motor control output lines and LED neopixel indicator for direct temperature readout, 5V Usb drive
 - circuit to drive 120 VAC power plugs with output from a dynamo, with decent sized water wheels, I think this a UPS with a 12 V supply for the 12 V battery, should be made from trash
 - interface between smart phone and pair of stepper motors for generic two motor robot control 
 
 
 
this is a complete enough technical set that it can have a huge physical impact on the world even without the next volume, and then the next volume is truly a work for people who want to push the boundaries of science and trash magic together, with emphasis on applied physics.  Maybe there will be a volume three that is biological and chemical 
 	

encourage collaboration so that those who don't want to learn electronics can get free electronics from those who do, and can find other ways to contribute, with art, assembly, craft, and the important courier service that needs to happen for distribution. 

Recruiting couriers might be the most important of these construction tasks, as I will be always building more artifacts myself and spreading the teachings of how to do it face to face, which can't spread as fast as the book can.  The book can spread *very* fast, and build a courier network so that physical artifacts can also if the book spreads the courier network very fast(it should also explicitly encourage readers to spread the word fast), and I can make artifacts fast, the limiting factor in growth will be the spread of the craft of artifact creating and the use of the new things.  

Thus my problem is the same as that of Kano in forming the Kodokan: how I teach the first students and how I organize the information conveyed to them shapes how they pass it on, and that will propagate through the whole subsequent series of events.  How did Kano start?  How did Ueshiba?  Why was Kano able to build a more functional system than Ueshiba?  

## public guerilla art

how to do installations, how to fix them how to document them, how to expand them how to move them, documentation of installations around the world, USB chargers are best to start with


from the blog:

I have figured out the nature of the first phase of technology development: guerilla  faery art.  I’ve been getting distracted by the long term goals of functionality for industrial production, but for this first volume aimed at non technical readers, it makes sense to focus on technology which will make sense and be obviously worth spreading: guerilla faery art.  What is this?   Art outside the capitalist system, installed without permission, built from trash and powered from freely available energy, and with a view toward exposing people to the of magic of the physical world.  There will be oscillators and motors and pumps and strobe lights and magnetic pickups and all kinds of blinking lights and speakers for sound and microscopic views of living things.

The electrochemical probe and full robotic system belongs to the second volume on Trash Magic.  That is geared to  people who want to delve deeply into the way electromagnetic trash magic works, focusing on fluid ion transport to interact with living systems, along with the basic infrastructure needed for a good life.  The more advanced stuff will be just described in the first volume, not built out with detailed plans.

What does this mean for things to build?

Materials and how to mount things in place matter.  This gives me an excuse to go down to all the creeks and find the right sticks and rocks and trash locally that can be repurposed for an installation.  Some missions will require stealth.

Viewing of microscopic objects must be extremely robust and require no turning on or off or care on a day to day basis.  Obviousness is key here, the view port has to be so obvious that everyone will automatically use it.  Also the subject has to naturally flow in constantly, with some trickle from a living stream so that something interesting, whatever the subject is, is usually present.

What specifically needs to get built to have finished products, and where do they go?  Some things will be deployed in wild areas, some in urban areas, and some will be gifts to artists.

A tentative and partial list of Guerilla Faery Art:

- USB charger with water wheel
- water wheel that generates electricity which drives oscillator stick with rocks on it, just vibrates forever with feedback
- same, but with LEDs with a pattern to make 3d POV art in the water
- water wheel turns triboelectric generator using bottles and such to build up high voltage which creates an arc over the water between aluminum covered plastic bottles, very visible at night!
- art piece as gift where a vibrator vibrates water, making waves, which can be observed using a strobe, and turned into audio with a magnetic float and amplified magnetic pickup.  With the magnifier built into the wood/plastic/stone water containers, this connects the main technologies if it’s USB powered, and is the perfect Main Gift for this phase.
- 3d manipulator with 3d input, hung from a tree or bridge over the water, which powers all motors and control circuits.  Anyone happening by and seeing the setup can grab the input rock and move it around, which will drive the moving platform around in 3d space above the water.  This probe can have the crude sonic electrochemical probe tuned to respond to depth in the water, so that the user can make sound by controlling the probe around in the water. Here art, science and technology are all one thing, built from trash, and in a public place with no declared ownership.
- water channel with strobe and vibrational drive for visual effects at night, driven by water wheel, runs all the time
- evaporative cooling refrigerator driven by water wheel
- hotplate driven by water wheel
- warm water pool heated by water wheel and generator
- steam powered organ using tubes and steam generated from water wheel
- datalog of creek which can connect to phones and twitter
 

Focusing on the main thing for now it’s probably the USB driven art piece without the generator, just a wall charge for a off the shelf lipo battery, or left plugged in.  A wave tank with a strobe can have a tunable 2d shape projected by the sun down onto an area, with musical output based on the wave patterns.  This could be installed in a tree, projecting through glass, with water piped from the top of a waterfall.  But what powers it?  No, I need the charger for the guerilla installation, but not for the art gift.

 

Art gift should be simpler than that, project up and along the side, with lights under transluscent plastic in the stick.  Vibrator stick with rocks on it bounces, with a stick that can be adjusted to agitate the water with different wave shapes and frequencies and amplitudes.  The magnets and rocks can also be moved to change the properties.  Water propagates down carved channels in a fat bottom stick with the drive stick bolted to it as well as the bouncing stick which is fixed at the end opposite the water.  Lenses can be put above the water to magnify what is in it as well as to project light in various directions both for art and for observation.  A little wave pool at the opposite end of the water agitator has a float with a tiny magnet in it, and the audio flux amplifier is wound around this pool, so that the sound is picked up and amplified and has an audio out socket.  A beautiful carved wooden knob is used to adjust the strobe properties by changing a 555 circuit.

This is the first thing!  Build this art gift first, before the water wheel, it’s self contained and can be distributed and used in classes I can teach and spread the work.  Lack of water wheel is not serious for most people since they charge devices anyway with USB and can get  a lipo at a gas station for 10 dollars.
