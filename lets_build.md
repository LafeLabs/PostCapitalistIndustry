# let's build this!


- how to make a thing
- how to ship a thing
- how you can get finished goods and join a value circle
- how you can make stuff and start a value circle
- how you can do a research project and start a value circle
- how to transport a thing from the maker to the user
- how to find your ambient energy resources
- what you can do to spread the word and build community
- Other academic work you can contribute as a scholar
- Machines you could build outside this system which can start a new value circle


This section should have some basic assembly plans and information to get started even without the second volume.  

Things to make here:

- vibrational oscillator with musical pickup
- 3d input device
- 3d manipulator, linked to input device
- wood cutting for circuits techniques
- plastic welding techniques
- waterwheel generator to 5V USB charger
- skeletron guide, with pictures, cartoons, detailed instructions, several plans:
	- tent
	- water wheel
	- tripod for manipulator and probe
	- vibrational musical instrument
	- boat
- high voltage generator
- strobe microscope
- LED art vibrator display
- basic electrochemical probe
- temperature regulator with hoist and thermometer and fire
- ambient art pieces powered off water and wind that use electricity to do things which can be repaired forever by anyone and moved and rebuilt and replaced by anyone

this is a complete enough technical set that it can have a huge physical impact on the world even without the next volume, and then the next volume is truly a work for people who want to push the boundaries of science and trash magic together, with emphasis on applied physics.  Maybe there will be a volume three that is biological and chemical 
 	
	  

encourage collaboration so that those who don't want to learn electronics can get free electronics from those who do, and can find other ways to contribute, with art, assembly, craft, and the important courier service that needs to happen for distribution. 

Recruiting couriers might be the most important of these construction tasks, as I will be always building more artifacts myself and spreading the teachings of how to do it face to face, which can't spread as fast as the book can.  The book can spread *very* fast, and build a courier network so that physical artifacts can also if the book spreads the courier network very fast(it should also explicitly encourage readers to spread the word fast), and I can make artifacts fast, the limiting factor in growth will be the spread of the craft of artifact creating and the use of the new things.  

Thus my problem is the same as that of Kano in forming the Kodokan: how I teach the first students and how I organize the information conveyed to them shapes how they pass it on, and that will propagate through the whole subsequent series of events.  How did Kano start?  How did Ueshiba?  Why was Kano able to build a more functional system than Ueshiba?
