\subsection{Ninth Contemplation: Moebius
Tire}\label{ninth-contemplation-moebius-tire}

The Moebius strip symbolizes the sides of the car conveyor belt being
one: creation and waste, destruction and construction. Go out into the
world and find a car part alone in the dirt. They are everywhere. Just a
shard of plastic or metal or rubber. Then bring it home, color in your
page, and stand on your head and sing a song while contemplating the
total destruction of all cars and the creation of a new world.
