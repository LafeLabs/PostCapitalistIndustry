Resonators are fundamental to all things in the universe.  

conjugate variables and Energy

f, Q, and Z

f vs. omega

Impedance transoformers and machines

List of resonators:

- water waves
- gravity waves
- EM waves:light, radio, xrays, gamma, IR, etc.
- sound waves
- earthquakes
- microwave oven driver
- wiggling of animals
- bouncing of tree branches
- whistles 
- music strings 	
- superstrings
- electrons
- atoms
- quanta
- superconducting condensate
- Bose Einstein Condensate


For all of the above, look at Q or continuous equivalent, impedance, frequencies, what the conjugate variables are, and how to measure, and why we care, dig up the berkeley physics course waves book and get this all right at a scholarly level.  Give examples you can do with stuff around you.

Analyze whether it makes sense to put an MRI section here.  Can I use a vibrating permanent magnet combined with an accelerometer and/or optical interferometer and a basic high gain RF circuit to do hand-held MRI with readout on a smartphone?  I need to work through the math, ask some experts, and if it's plausible, MRI can live in the resonance chapter, which connects all our resonator work with quantum mechanics.  

Add smart phone work, get accelerometer data, analyze it, hang smart phone from a long rope, do a pendulum experiment. Put phone on spring and  mass oscillators, more measurement of a(t) to get v(t) and x(t) by integration.
