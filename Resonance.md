Resonators are fundamental to all things in the universe.  

conjugate variables and Energy

f, Q, and Z

f vs. omega

Impedance transoformers and machines

List of resonators:

- water waves
- gravity waves
- EM waves:light, radio, xrays, gamma, IR, etc.
- sound waves
- earthquakes
- microwave oven driver
- wiggling of animals
- bouncing of tree branches
- whistles 
- music strings 	
- superstrings
- electrons
- atoms
- quanta
- superconducting condensate
- Bose Einstein Condensate


For all of the above, look at Q or continuous equivalent, impedance, frequencies, what the conjugate variables are, and how to measure, and why we care, dig up the berkeley physics course waves book and get this all right at a scholarly level.  Give examples you can do with stuff around you.
