## Second Contemplation: Tetrahedral Fractal

Sit and look at a free fractal thing in nature while you color this in.  This is symbolizing the fractal nature of truly free things.  Trees and shrubs are all free.  Contemplate their fractal nature and their ability to build this massive structure from the tiny whips of passing carbon dioxide from the air over many  years.  Incredible!  The tetrahedral fractal geometry shown in 3d here symbolizes the union of our human geometry with that of nature.

In this case we flop around on the ground in a more peaceful way, more slowly, at tai chi speeds even, to try to incorporate the slow pace of the tree into our thoughts.
