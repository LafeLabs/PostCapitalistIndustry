### Trash wizard multi tool
I want the trash wizard multi tool to be able to measure inductance easily. How to do that? I want the L/R time of something to be long enough to see something on the arduino ADC. But what R? If L is 0.001 H and R is 1 ohm, L/R is 1 ms. Perhaps a 1 ohm shunt resistor somewhere.

 Or maybe I want to measure the reverse EMF from changing the current quickly through the coil. V = L dI/dT. For a 1k series resistor driven by 3 V we have 3 mA of current. If that can turn off or on in a few microseconds, it should be possible to induce a good fraction of a volt. But given that the sign will reverse, having this go to ground would be a problem for the ADCs on the arduino. So what I want is a 500 ohm resistor going from the DAC to a node between two 500 ohm resistors in series making a voltage divider between 0 V and 3.3 V. that middle node then goes to the ADC and pulses should be visible. This I will not proceed to build and test.### kook industry
I think I have decided I want to join the kook industry. I have noticed that on Amazon there are people selling e- books for 0.99 cents about the end of the world, nuclear war, all sorts of crazy stuff. Then there are you tube people who make a living doing really dangerous things with electricity. And professional trolls who somehow get food and shelter from strangers all over the internet in support of their asshole online persona. I don’t want to be any of these specifically. I don’t want to sell an e-book about the end of the world, be an asshole for money, or court death with high voltage youtube experiments.
But I do think I’m realizing that I can’t function, or rather refuse to function, in normal society and that this makes me a member of the kook industry. I’m seeing this whole world more and more. Years ago I had a job with a friend delivering furniture. It was a super fun summer, although I was glad to stop when it was over. But one thing I realized was that there was a whole world of pairs of guys who drive around. Delivery guys, maintenance guys, cops, pool cleaners, and a range of other jobs that are usually done by two guys who often have time to stop at the same dunk n donuts. Many jobs, but one world.
And I think the kook industry is similar. Some are college professors, others are called artists, others are called activists, others bloggers, but fundamentally what people in the kook industry do is similar. The kook industry produces media content of various kinds that people can consume to get ideas outside the mainstream.
 So now I think I’ve defined my problem. I’m not going to get a job, I’m not going to sell stuff. Or not useful stuff. I’m going to distribute weird information and get paid by patrons. That patron might be a consulting client, people buying weird shit online they don’t need, youtube fans... who knows. But that’s the goal. What i want to do for society that I actually get compensated for is create very odd ideas that cause change in the world. In a post apocalyptic society I’ll point out eccentric and useful ways to move water around or something.
 The next step here is to build a media presence for my lab with the technical goals spelled out and a clear channel to produce content that people want and also that can get people involved to build out the post capitalist infrastructure so this can grow beyond money. I want the financial scale of the project to be very modest, to not have a for profit or non profit corporation, just me and whatever other weirdos I can recruit to this corner of the kook industry.
Now for a manifesto and a place to put it, onward!
###  Free Phones of the FutureOne of the many idiotic things capitalists say to shut up their critics is to point out that capitalism is the source of the smart phones that anti capitalists inevitably use.These devices are indeed amazing, and are no longer luxury items by any means. On the contrary, they are very much a survival tool used by the oppressed classes now, and it’s very dangerous to ignore that role this technology plays. But what aspect of them is so great? The social networking. That’s always what you need: access to the web, various messaging systems, and various commercial things like Uber and Lyft.
Does that really need to be a computer? A truly free phone would be a pure communication tool that communicates in a distributed way like fido net of old. the sole purpose of the hardware would be to communicate images, sounds, text, and to decide where those should go. That’s it. What the hell do you need a computer for? Mostly so that The Man can spy on you and figure out how to sell you shit you don’t need, and force you to constantly throw more federal reserve debt back into the machine for more advanced machines to get more indoctrination to continue the cycle.

 It’s all bullshit! Don’t be fooled by the dominance of the computer technology into believing that’s inevitable. It’s not. We can get orders of magnitude more benefit from peer to peer networks than we do today as slaves to the military industrial machine if these phones were all free like freedom, linked up on free hardware all the way. This can actually be the basic informational skeleton of the value circles.
 I believe that the hardware can be re worked from the ground up based on our approach to applied electromagnetism to get something with totally new fab. But in the mean time, given that that is a lengthy applied physics research project, what can we do? My answer is to watch closely everything that has anything to do with Raspberry Pi and other “internet of things” projects in the open hardware domain. I say “open hardware” here and not free hardware, because it’s not free according to my strict definition: it relies on mine- driven fab and capitalism, and there is IP in the supply chain(and some other problems). But it’s way better in terms of open and free than the whole android/apple ecosystem.
as seen here:https://www.adafruit.com/products/2885 (https://www.adafruit.com/products/2885)The pi zero sells for 5 dollars! And it’s free like freedom as far as the software goes, as I understand it. The problem of course is that it’s not what you’d call a product still. You need to buy a screen separately, and a battery, and some other odds and ends, and then put a package together, get all the software working, etc. It’s not trivial. Not insanely hard, but not trivial and also not really as usable as a apple or android.But surely this could change? If people want to work within the system of existing “tech” a fantastic place to focus efforts would be making this technology closer to truly free. This will be a combination of figuring out sourcing logistics on the hardware, making the software closer to what a phone user expects, and writing new software to make more free infrastructure that runs on the free hardware. If a truly free platform were to allow for the kind of peer to peer labor and goods sharing that for profit platforms now have, capitalism might just collapse overnight as people spontaneously are able to work and do things by communicating freely.
Don’t like the phone but like “tech”? make a free phone. It will happen one way or the other, but the more ways it happens the better for everyone.### How to Build the Team to build the TechnologyI’m clearly not going to build all the things I’m describing here. And even the things I do build, I hope to have what I build be a insignificant fraction of the total number of units produced in the future. How to recruit? Who to recruit? Where will they work? I’ve been contemplating these questions, and I see several ways to proceed.
Largely the various ways forward will involve decisions about where to be on the spectrum of working inside the system vs. outside. Some choices will involve getting very conventional, and I fear they will end up being coopted by the existing system. One of those would be to structure the way ARPA was in ins heyday. Many top academic, corporate, and government research labs could receive targeted funds to work on problems, where the funds come from various donations and military applied science grant money. The work would then be done by the usual suspects: grad students, post docs, and various staff researchers inside the current system. I think the biggest danger here is that the developed technologies will not be free in the real sense because it’s so hard for a expensive R&D lab to ever build a thing that’s not based on expensive equipment.  
 Another way forward is to focus on commercial applications in the old economy. One could for instance build a very reliable and cheap water pump, and build a rapidly growing for-profit company on that which funds R&D to free technology through its profits. This is, I think, the worst of all possible choices. Capitalism poisons everything it touches. And I think the way I’m going to define capitalism for the purpose of this work is “the belief that value can be measured using numbers”. It’s that simple. Any kind of money or equivalent value unit that can be counted is the poison we all know from our capitalist nightmare, and that’s what I’m going to focus on purging from the technological supply chain.
 At the other end of the spectrum, one imagines seizing a abandoned factory building and building the R&D infrastructure up from scratch in a squat environment. I predict that going too far down this path ends with the usual endless war with cops and landlords that always happens when good people try to use land without the System. Even if you imagine buying the land so that there are no direct legal challenges, cops and landlords will be an ever-present problem, as will generating enough federal reserve debt to keep the bastards off our backs. A lot of time will have to be spent on just keeping the site running.
Seizing land and building up the means of production makes sense when you have a working technology that can be instantly deployed and then also broken down and moved later when you need to move. But before the technology is mature, it makes sense to be completely distributed geographically. Also, for this project to work as I want it too, we need strong cooperation between the developing world and the developed world, and between diverse people living on land that has different types of local resources available from whatever their local trash streams are, as well as the very diverse energy considerations, and the diverse cultural considerations which should be considered early not later.
How does this distributed system work? I believe part of it involves the structure of the actual book document. I don’t feel that the Jupiter notebooks are quite where I want them yet, but they’re close, and I think that the structure will be based on software that comes out of that basic structure. Users will make modules to solve various technical problems, as well as post new ones, and they’ll all be integrated into the combined book. This is, in many ways, what the open source software people do using their git hub bullshit. I think git up is a giant festering piece of shit, however, and loathe most software communities, so this is a tricky game. Somehow the innovations from that world should be used without poisoning the whole project and creating yet another tech bro shit head club.
One way I want to differentiate from a lot of computer software bullshit is by having a coherent narrative. Something that drives me crazy about their culture is that things are so distributed that you can’t actually figure out where to start. It’s not just that there are forks, it’s that there are many forks all the time for everything and everyone is a giant dick about all of it. I’m not above simply banning anyone with any tech company affiliations from contributing to the main document.
This is a book. A book is a finite thing. As time goes on content will be added, but other content will also be deleted. It will all be archived, but if someone wants to they can approach from zero, start at the beginning, and have a coherent narrative to follow as they build up to actually having the ability to use the technology themselves. There will be various versions to account for many human languages as well as some various tracks that might exist, but all of the parallel versions and tracks must be self contained and linear(or at least with the option of treating them as linear). I need to keep a very close eye on how things progress with the various jupiter like things out there, because it’s moving fast. It all has to work on a free trash wizard stick, but
 that should be fine with the HTML5 stuff that everything now runs on inside a browser. Is there a simple way to go back and forth between jupiter notebooks and a fully compiled .pdf in book format? Surely there is, and if not, it should be some combination of existing scripts chained together.
 My job as initial author is to create well posed problems in the first draft of the book, and to make it appealing for people to contribute solutions to those problems. This will be extremely hard to get right on a first pass, and part of getting this whole thing to work will involve shifting that format over time. When things are really working, the R&D will be all done in the value circle economy, where people are constantly creating that form of value as they do R&D. This has the potential to be a very hard chicken-and-egg problem: the book needs a lot of work in order to have value circles work, but without value circles people can’t work on it effectively. That’s why this all starts with me working alone in my underwear at home. And remains that way for a while. Because I need to first have the system working with me as the only user, then me and some close associates, then a few “followers” who just build kits, and then, when that team has worked for a few years, more people can ease their way into the system to grow it. Of course as the serial/parallel global crises of capitalist disaster accelerate, we may find that things grow explosively instead. If that happens it happens, but I will plan for something that is built much more carefully.
This blog post was going to go into a list if the types of experts needed to get the various jobs done, but on looking where it ended up going that looks more and more like a useless exercise at this time. I’ll build up the vision of what should get built, build my own parts of that technology and distribute them, and then a sort of chemical potential will form which brings in the right experts. It’s dangerous to specify exact professional qualifications too early, as it will end up losing out on some opportunities to bring in talent outside the organized technical professions, which creates lots of biases in class, race, nationality, age, etc. It’s much better to pose problems clearly with no jargon, in as many ways as possible and just see who turns up with a solution.
### WE COME FROM PLANET JUPYTER AND MEAN YOU NO HARM
Well, it’s happened. I’ve become a raving Jupyter evangelist. This stuff spreads like wild fire. Whether I’m talking to a sex toy engineer, a rare book librarian, or a quantum computing person, I can’t stop trying to drag them into the world of Jupyter. IT’S THE BEST FUCKING THING EVER.http://jupyter.org (http://jupyter.org)It mixes between LaTeX and a form of python designed to copy the look and feel of matlab but with much better documentation and more complete packages. And there are tools set up for sharing of data and analysis on the web with it.To me, this is a little peek into the future of the scientific process. Pushing forward into the speculative, I think in the future, you’ll take all your data directly to the cloud, where everyone in the community can see it, and analyze it there. Anyone who wants can fork your experiment to their bit of the cloud, analyze it themselves, and link back from your data to their analysis. Your close colleagues will get updates that scroll along in real time like Facebook or twitter, and publishing will be a series of things getting up voted or promoted more heavily. Actual papers structured the old way will be much more pedagogical. With the data and analysis  
happening constantly in real time and shared through the community, the only reason to write a full paper is to really help people understand things. A bunch of this involves software that’s not quite written yet, but this whole Jupyter notebook thing is a huge leap toward it.
