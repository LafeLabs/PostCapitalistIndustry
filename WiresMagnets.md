1. go read all about copper and wires, write it up with references and notes
2. make a set of super dooper python notebooks for all cases of wire calls
3. go around by bike and find trash and experiment with what has good magnet wire, measure the gauge
4. using the trash wire, derive and document careful post apocalyptic method of measuring AWG, make ample links 
5. more clear standards and nomenclature for coils of various kinds made, FULLY DOCUMENTED, and also self-documented with data physically on/in the artifact that points to the repository with the standard as well as the specific story of fabrication.  This is where coil making really gets serious!!! With the coil winder this can get even more serious. make reference to Bruce Sterling's "spime" concept.
6. go find books on the history and vital statistics of ferrite magnets, iron, etc, cite and write
7. same with rare earth, look up trade journals etc, ask around, get the full global amount, understand where it all comes from, maybe talk to experts
8. transformers: build big step ups, make mechanically driven high voltage zapper with some transformers, take apart and photograph transformers from trash, measure them, find information on global transformer production, analyze a car for transformers that are available
9. More documentation on drive coil circuit, full explanation, a tour of how to drive a coil

figures:

1. photos of copper wire in trash
2. photos of different kinds of copper wires
3. photos of method for measuring AWG size directly
4. photos of coil winding machine
5. diagram of global copper supply chain and energy budget, money budget, mass in atoms
6. transformer cartoons and photos
7. magnet photos and cartoons, refernce back to fields
8. lots of detailed diagrams on coil specs of various kinds


## Section I: Wires 


1. why is copper such a great metal for wire?
2. how much copper is there in the world?
3. how do we get copper, how does copper mining and refining  work?
4. how do you make copper wire?  how does the insulator work?
5. other insulation concerns
6. what is gauge and how do we measure it?
7. how and where to we salvage free wire?



## Magnets

1. history of magnets
2. rare earth magnets
3. magnet sourcing: iron and rare earth 
4. magnetic permeability and transformers


## Magnets and wires together

drive coils, pickup coils, etc.
