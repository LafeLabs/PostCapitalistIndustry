Start by building and documenting some actual robots, make a rumble, rumble the rumble with the trash wizard stick.  

1. hopper dumb robot
2. hopper with a brain using raspberry pi for browser to pi to board to motor robot control
3. roller robot
4. rolling ball robot
5. hopper rumble
6. make a mobile robot that can use a hot tool to rework thermo plastics
7. floating robot that can re work thermo plastic(loop back to these on fractal reactor chapter)




# Free Robots for Free Hardware

# Rumbles of Robots

Add: littoral robot rumbles which can use tides and river currents to generate electricity to propel themselves upstream.  Can be amphimious, use water to charge but land to move, can move with hopping, jumping, walking, rolling, and slithering.  Littoral trash cleanup robots are fundable, can make a huge difference in cleanup of a waterway, and also give us free source material for more building.
