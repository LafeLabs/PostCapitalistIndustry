Biography and Mission

Build applied physics for industrial development in a post capitalist world. I define capitalism as a system where human values are represented by integer numbers, combined with certain religious beliefs.  Those beliefs include the existence of private property as a concept, human misery as a source of value(work and the wage system), and the belief  that value derives from mined materials.  

I believe that this set of religious beliefs has been efficient at extracting vast mineral and energy wealth from the Earth and building a lot of machines that make life easier for some humans(but not most).  


I work alone, following my personal code and set of rules:
no patents, etc.

start by selling 3d printed eye balls that are painted and ready to deploy with JB weld on a wall

Technology should all be one link, keep it focused and short:

Past Technology(separate link, describe all these, have pictures)

* carbon nanotechnology
* Single electron transistors
* Quantum computation
* shot noise thermometer
* SQUID microwave amplifier
* Josephson parametric amplifiers
* High torque personal massager(x1 orgasmatron)[learned that capitalism is broken]
			we failed because our *exponential* growth was not *steep* enough.  this is a crazy way to deploy new technology. Having now done startups I've done technology with big companies, startups, small business, government and universities.  And it's all bullshit. 
* "Ambrosia", first ever bionic dildo, haptic prosthetic
* The philosophy engine, the Free Motor project, Trash Magic
* E&M demonstrations for undergraduate physics education

	
Present Technology(separate link, describe and add pictures)

* Parametric oscillator devices
* Free Motors
* Free robots
* Hobby electronics, making things easier
