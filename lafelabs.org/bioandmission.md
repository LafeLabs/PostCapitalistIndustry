Biography and Mission

Build applied physics for industrial development in a post capitalist world. I define capitalism as a system where human values are represented by integer numbers, combined with certain religious beliefs.  Those beliefs include the existence of private property as a concept, human misery as a source of value(work and the wage system), and the belief  that value derives from mined materials.  

I believe that this set of religious beliefs has been efficient at extracting vast mineral and energy wealth from the Earth and building a lot of machines that make life easier for some humans(but not most), but that it has far outlived its usefulness.  Note that when I say "capitalism", I'm using my own definition, which includes every modern nation state including the USSR and its various satellites: anyone who uses money and the basic concept of wealth based on that is that category. 

I work alone, following my personal code and set of rules:
no patents, etc.
