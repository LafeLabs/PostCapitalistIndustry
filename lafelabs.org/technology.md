Past Technology(separate link, describe all these, have pictures)

* carbon nanotechnology
* Single electron transistors
* Quantum computation
* shot noise thermometer
* SQUID microwave amplifier
* Josephson parametric amplifiers
* High torque personal massager(x1 orgasmatron)[learned that capitalism is broken]
			we failed because our *exponential* growth was not *steep* enough.  this is a crazy way to deploy new technology. Having now done startups I've done technology with big companies, startups, small business, government and universities.  And it's all bullshit. 
* "Ambrosia", first ever bionic dildo, haptic prosthetic
* The philosophy engine, the Free Motor project, Trash Magic
* E&M demonstrations for undergraduate physics education

	
Present Technology(separate link, describe and add pictures)

* Parametric oscillator devices
* Free Motors
* Free robots
* Hobby electronics, making things easier
