### this chapter should have a section with a detailed example
maps, tables, really dig in and figure out the strategy and tactics that could be used, maybe have multiple examples, small liberal arts, huge public school, elite private school, community college in a big city

### The Universities are a Disaster


* Academia as pyramid scam

* Academia as tool of the military industrial State

* Academia as a marketing tool for the banking cartel

* Academia: where ideas go to die

* Academia: it was here before capitalism and it will be here after

* Has traditionally been a part of various religions and patriarchal systems connected with them

IP is key to how bad it is, academia after the re-occupation of the campus all property will be banned from campus.

### But they're really useful to us

Back to basics: knowledge, teaching, philosophy, technology, culture, books, land, food and energy

Universities must be Occupied and declared independent

This should be across disciplines and outside of the capitalist class system, bringing in workers, locals, students, teachers, researchers and everyone else involved.  Seize the legal control of the corporation that is the University, and you will have a power that States must respect.  

Taking universities over can be a huge international beach head that goes around all national borders.

DPL description:

"Our federal and state tax dollars are going to fund higher education. If corporations kick in a little more, should they be able to dictate the research or own the discoveries?During the past two decades, commercial forces have quietly transformed virtually every aspect of academic life. Corporate funding of universities is growing and the money comes with strings attached. In return for this funding, universities and professors are acting more and more like for-profit patent factories: university funds are shifting from the humanities and the less profitable science departments into research labs, and the skill of teaching is valued less and less. Slowly but surely, universities are abandoning their traditional role as disinterested sources of education, alternative perspectives, and wisdom.This growing influence of corporations over universities affects more than just today's college students (and their parents); it compromises the future of all those whose careers depend on a university education, and all those who will be employed, governed, or taught by the products of American universities."
