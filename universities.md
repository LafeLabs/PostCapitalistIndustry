### The Universities are a Disaster


* Academia as pyramid scam

* Academia as tool of the military industrial State

* Academia as a marketing tool for the banking cartel

* Academia: where ideas go to die

* Academia: it was here before capitalism and it will be here after


### But they're really useful to us

Back to basics: knowledge, teaching, philosophy, technology, culture, books, land, food and energy

Universities must be Occupied and declared independent

This should be across disciplines and outside of the capitalist class system, bringing in workers, locals, students, teachers, researchers and everyone else involved.  Seize the legal control of the corporation that is the University, and you will have a power that States must respect.  

Taking universities over can be a huge international beach head that goes around all national borders.
