The university system is a disaster in just about every way possible.  However the *potential* of this system is too great to ignore.  The potential of all those excited young people ready to change the world who also happen to be on some of the nicest land in the world, in institutions which have a fair amount of independence can truly change the world if they change how they are run. 

Much of this chapter should not be written by me but by the people who are scholars of the history of student insurrections.  Student insurrection has been a critical component of both university life and revolutionary practice for many centuries.  There are whole movements dedicated to this kind of work, some of which are documented in the Undercommons Project at <http://undercommoning.org>.  If you are on a university campus, study the links contained there and study university history and the history of student revolt globally.  Study this history and learn how to apply it to your own story and your own campus.  


## Universities: Visions of Utopia

If the university campus lived up to its potential it could be a true paradise: essentially a giant garden filled with buildings for studying and creating knowledge.  Amazing!  They are usually situated on some of the best land to be found anywhere, have great access to everything needed in life, and have dense urban style housing in a pastoral environment which allows for a simple, car free life.  

University campuses are often physically spectacular.  They often have some of the greatest examples of art and architecture of available both used in their construction and lovingly maintained for in some cases hundreds of years.  It is typical for them to have wooded areas owned by the university, as well as often running water and in many cases access to very large bodies of water.  University campuses are often more self contained than most institutions, creating their own power and managing their own utilities, and having a fair amount of autonomy from local government.  


## Undergraduate Education: Broken Promises

 The college education has become a key element in the great lie of the American middle class dream.  It is also a major factor in the older generation destroying the opportunities they had for the younger generation.  

College has become just another capitalist cartel, exploiting the hopes of young people in exchange for a life of debt servitude.  Young people are still told by their elders that a college education is needed to enter the middle class, which is supposed to be a good thing.  They're told that the price is justified by long term earnings.  Then they're sent off to live in a party resort for 5 years where they shuffle through a series of pointless and irrelevant classes, and wind up with a bill of many tens of thousands of dollars(this is primarily an American problem, but the neoliberals will bring it to your country soon enough if they're not crushed at the global level).  

And what do we learn there?  Theory! Propaganda! How to write papers no one will read about stuff no one cares about.  100 year old science.  At this point defenders of the System start howling about "pure knowledge", by which they mean theory over "applied knowledge", by which they mean actual knowledge about how the world works.  Theory is a virus, a disease, and a religion, and it has no place here.

What should we learn?  Same subjects, but useful.  Why can't biology majors make drugs?  Why can't physics majors build a flying drone?  Why can't chemistry majors build a water desalination plant?  Many subjects should, I think, be totally eliminated, as they have no real value, such as economics and computer "science".  

## Science Grad School: The Ponzi Scheme

You don't have to go to graduate school to see how much it resembles a pyramid scam.  Suppose any one professor has about five graduate students at a time, each of whom takes about five years to graduate with a PhD.  If a professor does this for 30 years, they will create on average one PhD per year or 30 PhD's total.  Now suppose all those PhD's find jobs similar to what their advisor has.  This is possible only if the size of the field increases by 30 times in 30 years.  Very crudely this corresponds to about 12% per year.  Given the expansion of the physical sciences and their satellites in the years during and directly after World War II, building a scheme like this in those years actually made some sense.  However, those days are decades behind us, and now as research budgets shrink and schools, companies, and government agencies are systematically destroyed by politics, this math looks much more like a pyramid scam than a response to society's needs.

As a grad student you will *probably* never get the job you're supposedly being trained for.  But you will dedicate 5-7 years of your life to helping someone who *did* get that job to continue to climb the academic ladder.  The people at the bottom of the academic pyramid spend their lives working to help the people at the top, and then are mostly cast aside.    

The tenure clock then puts yet another opportunity for exploitation in the career path, making yet another way for people now well into middle age to work long hours for more years to build up an academy that they might then be cast out of.  


## Hollowing Out of the Academy

There are many factors that have contributed to the downfall of the university system over the last few years.  I would argue that since Ronald Reagan was elected president of the United States in 1980 there has been a coordinated ideological war against all culture that might exist outside of the profit system, and that universities have felt the brunt of this particularly hard.  

A robust, healthy, independent, and publicly supported university system could provide a real balance against mainstream corporate power if it existed.  It is therefore strategically important for the lords of global corporate rule that they be as controlled as possible by corporations and the central government so that they cannot exercise a check on those forms of power.  


## Intellectual Property 

Intellectual property deserves its own section here because it has been so corrosive to the culture of the academy in so many ways.  This manifesto is opposed to all forms of private property, and particularly intellectual property, but the patenting and copyrighting of work done in universities is particularly evil.  

It is now standard practice for public tax money to be spent to create knowledge which then goes into papers behind a paywall protected by brutal copyright enforcement and into patented or even trade secret knowledge.  If the rule of law actually meant anything this would clearly constitute a criminal theft from the public.  The fact that this is *not* considered a criminal act is in fact a major indication of the evil nature of the capitalists' so-called "rule of law".   

## Potential Paradises

How should a university work, after the fall of capitalism and the takeover of their administration?  They must be self-sufficient.  They must grow all their own food and produce all their own energy and industrial goods.  They must be able to maintain the core knowledge contained in the libraries with equal or superior care to the existing capitalist system, as that is the heart of the university.  

The education of the incoming young people who are now called "undergraduates" must be joined with the construction of this new world.  That is, undergraduates will combine learning with labor to actually physically grow the food, build the robots, build the industrial production, build the energy infrastructure etc. The graduate education will combine more advanced and specialized practical work with more scholarship: writing and reading as it has been done by scholars for thousands of years.  What are now called "staff" must be integrated into this as well, both on the scholarship and on the work and the development of new methods of work. Bringing the staff into your insurrection early also creates powerful allies for later on as you fully take over the school.  


## University Occupations, Phase 2

Any history of any radical movement will inevitably involve student occupations.  Students typically take over some space on campus, keep the land from the cops, and carry out various protest actions or teach ins over some number of days or maybe weeks.  In some cases they stand down after actually getting some demands met by the administration.   And then they end, and everyone moves on.  

I suggest that as with all occupations one way they can continue is to create art that can be moved and lasts and is taken from one action to another, creating a whole narrative that passes along both the ideas and products of each action to the next, creating a snowball effect.  The purpose of this chapter is to gently nudge people in the direction of building this kind of infrastructure instead of just running a protest as long as possible until the inevitable crackdown.  


## Case Study: Your School

You have to write this section and integrate it into your version of the text, if you are connected with a university.  

How much land does the school own?  Map that, and go walk the land and figure out what is on it and how it flows.  What energy resources are connected to that land?  A creek or river or ocean is your first choice.  In many cases the local river is near but not directly adjoining the campus.  Figure out what a supply chain would look like that would connect infrastructure you build between the cracks of the property society on that river with the campus.  Can you charge batteries in large numbers and bring them to campus using couriers?  Can you build hidden power lines to bring power in?  What about water, can you purify that, bottle it, and bring it in by courier?  Study the map you make of your campus and environs, and figure out what it would look like to get supply chains built up that will function under martial law, in all out war with the campus police.  

Do not just plan for the short term! If you play chess with the campus police you will lose; you want to play go.  In go, territory is captured and lost in a dynamic way, and those gains and losses can oscillate forever in theory.  You want to build long term strategy that involves not just holding an administration building for as long as possible, but to become a force that flows around campus, rising and falling as you see opportunities, and fading away.  University insurrections have always suffered from a lack of strategic thought in terms of how land is taken and held.  Realize that as soon as you create any sort of resistance fixed in geography you are handing advantage to the campus authorities.  You are fighting a guerrilla war, act accordingly.  

Also, the long term plan must be partly legal in nature, to exist within the capitalist state without further military escalation by authorities.  This means you need to recruit from the law school, and have people studying the corporate governance of your school specifically to figure out how to carry out a legal coup d'etat in which full legal control of the university corporation is won by the insurrectionists.  University corporate charters can be very complex and strange and old.  Legal documents like this often have strange legal loopholes which are hard to find but which can be exploited at the right moment in such a way that those who believe in the so-called "rule of law" can be convinced to side with the insurrection.  

Note that this "war" should never be about violence.  While the goals are similar to violent insurrections for a more democratic and free campus, the methods should never involve competing in violence with those who have made it their life's work(the campus police and their backers). Rather, we must win on superior infrastructure.  Build better things: better technology, better classes, better scholarship, better classrooms, better food, better housing, better libraries.  Do that and you can really win the academy back for the scholars away from the business scam artists who now run all universities.  


## Universities: a Global Beachhead

Taking universities over can be a huge international beach head that goes around all national borders.  Every country has them.  And they all have very energetic young people who want to change the world and try new things.  They can be of huge global importance in the years to come as the current system falls apart.  Capitalism is killing the universities, and the faculty who love the schools will see eventually that they have to abandon capitalism if they are to see what is good in the system continue past this century.
