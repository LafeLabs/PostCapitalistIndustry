## Capitalism and Morality

In Star Trek III, Kirk is discussing the morality of the whole crew of the Enterprise risking their lives to save Spock.  He quotes Spock back to him, from when in the previous film he says "the good of the many out weigh the good of the one".  Spock's response is "I would accept that as an axiom".  To me that phrase really stands out, and I believe that there is the kernel of a very deep truth here(such deep truths after all being Spock's specialty!)

My approach to this work is to build a moral code on a set of axioms, just as various disciplines of math are based on axioms.  This has proven to be an incredibly powerful way of organizing information and has been one of the reasons that mathematics has been so successful and so transformative for the human condition.   

An axiom is a statement made without proof.  It is not a theorem, a law, a rule, or an observation.  One simply chooses to make a statement and then builds up a intellectual structure on the assumption that that is true.  This does not imply the kind of cosmic absolute Truth that either religion or science or law claim to have.  Rather it is one attempt to build up a way of seeing the world and acting in that world. One of many, and which may be changed in the future.  For example, the axioms of geometry from Euclid are still taught in high schools across the world, although since then various other mathematicians have abandoned some of those axioms and built up whole new worlds of geometry.  Are these other worlds somehow more or less "True" then Euclids?  No. The geometer does not deal in Truth with a capital T.  The geometer works with geometry, which is built up from a set of axioms, which are just a tool.  

Thus as I write down a set of beliefs and assumptions and even definitions, I have no intent of "proving" these things as "True".  Rather it is my intent to build up a intellectual system which allows people to do useful work.  These ideas are tools, nothing more and nothing less. 

I frequently say a thing is either moral or immoral.  What I mean by that is that it is consistent or not with the set of beliefs about right and wrong which I consider to be axiomatic.  If you do not like these axioms, go write your own manifesto, build your own structure.  It is my intention that future thinkers extending this work do just that.  You will likely create things I disagree with that go in many other directions.  This is good and right. 

The first volume of this work goes into far more detail than I will here about the evils of capitalism or what to do to build industry outside of it.  Here I deal with the topic of capitalism briefly to outline a set of axioms on which the technical work will be based. 

### Definition 1. Capitalism is a belief system in which the integer numbers can be used to denote all human value.  

#### Axioms of Capitalism:

* The sum total of all existing "money" and equivalent numerical values tabulated by the capitalists is insufficient to ever compensate the victims of capitalism.  
* All contract law is based on exploitation and violence.  All laws going all the way  back to the beginning of our written civilization are based on upholding that violence and hold no moral validity.
* Private property is a system by which violence and oppression are laundered to allow people to conceal the true nature of what they "own".  The very existence of all private property in existence today is the product of violence, oppression and evil.  Justice will never exist by moving private property around, the only hope is eliminating the concept of private property.  

From these axioms we arrive at a set of design rules which will be applied to all technology development within the Trash Magic system.
