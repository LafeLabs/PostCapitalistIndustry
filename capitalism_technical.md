## Capitalism and Morality

In Star Trek III, Kirk is discussing the morality of the whole crew of the Enterprise risking their lives to save Spock.  He quotes Spock back to him, from when in the previous film he says "the good of the many out weigh the good of the one".  Spock's response is "I would accept that as an axiom".  To me that phrase really stands out, and I believe that there is the kernel of a very deep truth here(such deep truths after all being Spock's specialty!)

My approach to this work is to build a moral code on a set of axioms, just as various disciplines of math are based on axioms.  This has proven to be an incredibly powerful way of organizing information and has been one of the reasons that mathematics has been so successful and so transformative for the human condition.   

An axiom is a statement made without proof.  It is not a theorem, a law, a rule, or an observation.  One simply chooses to make a statement and then builds up a intellectual structure on the assumption that that is true.  This does not imply the kind of cosmic absolute Truth that either religion or science or law claim to have.  Rather it is one attempt to build up a way of seeing the world and acting in that world. One of many, and which may be changed in the future.  For example, the axioms of geometry from Euclid are still taught in high schools across the world, although since then various other mathematicians have abandoned some of those axioms and built up whole new worlds of geometry.  Are these other worlds somehow more or less "True" then Euclids?  No. The geometer does not deal in Truth with a capital T.  The geometer works with geometry, which is built up from a set of axioms, which are just a tool.  

Thus as I write down a set of beliefs and assumptions and even definitions, I have no intent of "proving" these things as "True".  Rather it is my intent to build up a intellectual system which allows people to do useful work.  These ideas are tools, nothing more and nothing less. 

I frequently say a thing is either moral or immoral.  What I mean by that is that it is consistent or not with the set of beliefs about right and wrong which I consider to be axiomatic.  If you do not like these axioms, go write your own manifesto, build your own structure.  It is my intention that future thinkers extending this work do just that.  You will likely create things I disagree with that go in many other directions.  This is good and right. 

The first volume of this work goes into far more detail than I will here about the evils of capitalism or what to do to build industry outside of it.  Here I deal with the topic of capitalism briefly to outline a set of axioms on which the technical work will be based. 

### Definition 1. Capitalism is a belief system in which the integer numbers can be used to denote all human value.  

#### Axioms of Capitalism:

* The sum total of all existing "money" and equivalent numerical values tabulated by the capitalists is insufficient to ever compensate the victims of capitalism.  
* All contract law is based on exploitation and violence.  All laws going all the way  back to the beginning of our written civilization are based on upholding that violence and hold no moral validity.
* Private property is a system by which violence and oppression are laundered to allow people to conceal the true nature of what they "own".  The very existence of all private property in existence today is the product of violence, oppression and evil.  Justice will never exist by moving private property around, the only hope is eliminating the concept of private property.  

From these axioms we arrive at a set of design rules which will be applied to all technology development within the Trash Magic system.  

### Capitalism stifles innovation

Capitalism has created what the capitalists call "perverse incentives" for all builders of technology.  I want to examine some forces that make capitalist technology anti-user, wasteful, low quality, short lifetime, and often useless and dangerous.  

1. Different is always better.  This is one of the most dangerous in applied physics in particular.  Applied physicists are usually driven by the need to generate intellectual property if they're in the private sector, and publications in the public sector and academia.  Either way, it's based on the concept of property as something one person can own.  Rather than unifying different ideas into one main functioning technology, there is always a motivation due to the economic forces that make us all need to publish, raise money and generate IP for shareholders of corporations to split off from some main technology a supposedly better fork.  But being better is never as important as being different.  

One of the things that sets metrology apart as a discipline from mainstream science is that prestige often belongs not to the first group to do a measurement but the the second or third who really does it right, and verifies the first measurements.  How can this be?  Because metrology generally operates in a NMI outside the forces of capitalism.  It's a much more communist model, in which the global community is small enough that all parties know who did what and credit can be clear without personal "ownership".  Also, because nations all sign a treaty to agree to the SI, this is a communal system, unlike the exploitative and exclusionary trade deals that are more typical of relations between the capitalist nations.  

2. New is always better.  Almost the same thing, but a little different.  In this case we see good products getting retired and replaced by randomly new products which may not be better but which are favored by sales and marketing because they're "new".  Newness for the sake of newness is one reason capitalist technology is so often broken.  Rather than refining designs from one generation to the next, each generation has to be considered "more advanced" in some way that is again based on IP, market segmentation etc. 

3. The fewer functions a tool does, the better.  What if your blender was your TV, which was also your commuter submarine and also your farming drone?  Right now each of those things is sold by a different company at a different price through a different sales channel, and if any of those were to overlap, one of those companies would have to go out of business or find yet another "new" thing. This is an incredibly evil and easy to miss aspect of capitalist technology and also applied physics which must be called out repeatedly.  

The capitalist will at this point object: but competition demands ever more features!  The new car has more electronic gadgets on the dash than the old!  But added features is not the same as true multi-use.  Sleeping in the back of your car is an example of something that really would qualify as multi use, because it eliminates the need to pay a landlord and also pay a car company.  And so it supports my thesis here to observe that it is usually illegal to sleep in your car.  Why?  How more plain can this be as a arrow pointing to the capitalist religious prohibition of real multi use?  There is plenty of multi use within the capitalist system, but it's generally in the "void the warranty" territory, and very clearly outside the System.  And not surprisingly again, the trade deals written by the global corporate overlords often specifically use the threat of physical force to suppress modification of technology outside that allowed by the "owners" of the technological "property".  

I think that reconsidering technological and applied physics development without the need to "create a market" it's clear that the quality of technology can be much higher.

4. The steeper an economy of scale there is, the more money you make.  This is also very pernicious.  A capitalist makes money by buying something for a dollar and selling it for two.  Why does the consumer tolerate this in a supposedly competitive environment?  Because they can't do it for a dollar, because of economies of scale.  You can often get plastic injection molded parts for a few cents each in large volume, but they'd be a few hundred CNC'd custom and maybe tens of dollars 3d printed.  So the factory "owner" can pay a few cents and make a few dollars while undercutting the only competition that is *at the scale the consumer actually needs.*

A major goal of technological development in the post capitalist environment is to remove these economies of scale, focusing on the *right* number of a thing, which is based on actual needs for a given number of people.  In general, I think if you can satisfy the needs of 50-150 people, it's about the right scale.   And since we are eliminating the use of money or any other association of numerical value with the process of making stuff, scale has a different meaning anyway.  What we want is for the labor input to be a net positive because it's some kind of art project or game or adventure, while also adding value to the community and providing a basic need while also
