## Capitalism and Morality

In Star Trek III, Kirk is discussing the morality of the whole crew of the Enterprise risking their lives to save Spock.  He quotes Spock back to him, from when in the previous film he says "the good of the many out weigh the good of the one".  Spock's response is "I would accept that as an axiom".  To me that phrase really stands out, and I believe that there is the kernel of a very deep truth here(such deep truths after all being Spock's specialty!)

My approach to this work is to build a moral code on a set of axioms, just as various disciplines of math are based on axioms.  This has proven to be an incredibly powerful way of organizing information and has been one of the reasons that mathematics has been so successful and so transformative for the human condition.   

An axiom is a statement made without proof.  It is not a theorem, a law, a rule, or an observation.  One simply chooses to make a statement and then builds up a intellectual structure on the assumption that that is true.  This does not imply the kind of cosmic absolute Truth that either religion or science or law claim to have.  Rather it is one attempt to build up a way of seeing the world and acting in that world. One of many, and which may be changed in the future.  For example, the axioms of geometry from Euclid are still taught in high schools across the world, although since then various other mathematicians have abandoned some of those axioms and built up whole new worlds of geometry.  Are these other worlds somehow more or less "True" then Euclids?  No. The geometer does not deal in Truth with a capital T.  The geometer works with geometry, which is built up from a set of axioms, which are just a tool.  

Thus as I write down a set of beliefs and assumptions and even definitions, I have no intent of "proving" these things as "True".  Rather it is my intent to build up a intellectual system which allows people to do useful work.  These ideas are tools, nothing more and nothing less. 

I frequently say a thing is either moral or immoral.  What I mean by that is that it is consistent or not with the set of beliefs about right and wrong which I consider to be axiomatic.  If you do not like these axioms, go write your own manifesto, build your own structure.  It is my intention that future thinkers extending this work do just that.  You will likely create things I disagree with that go in many other directions.  This is good and right. 

The first volume of this work goes into far more detail than this.
