# Section I: What is Skeletron?

Skeletron is the skeletal system of the technology.  There are many ways for a physical technology to have a skeletal system, but the one I choose for this work is based primarily off wooden sticks.  Finding a wooden stick and very similar bits of usable finished wood for free can be accomplished almost anywhere humans live.  


Skeletron should not just be wood: it is clear that plastic, salvaged from containers and heat and pressure welded, should be part of this.  How to build standard structural elements of plastic, how to weld it, how to build the weld tool.  

# How to Build

use of direct drive and motors to build power tools to shape it, how to scale, how to do 
various simple things like bearings, how to connect to other stuff

# Fasteners

I have started with quarter-20 bolts, but these need to be replaced by things that obey our design rules, i.e. are more versatile, easier to get, and exhibit more self similarity in their geometry.  I think this will be wood and metal pegs with conical shapes in a clever combination, and with melted plastic to hold it all in place.  Essentially this will be like cement with the wood, steel, or aluminum having the structural strength and the plastic holding it in place, just like rebar in concrete.  


perhaps there will be layers of self-similarity, with smaller skeletron parts fitting in larger ones, and smaller and smaller units acting as "pins" holding the larger ones in place: fractal fasteners.  This is based on designing fasters from scratch as a concept.

several holes in different places, similar angles but don't have to exactly match, different materials can be used interchangeably: wood, plastic, metal, composites of plastic wood and metal all together.  Some fasteners will combine materials. Composite fasteners can also have decoration and data storage. 

# Specification, medium of Exchange

This is a crude middle ground between the Value Circle and "money".  Skeletron elements with great art and more use can be traded as quasi currency along with simple elements and raw materials.  This creates some interface between our world and theirs and makes it easier to help people on the margins quickly in tangible material ways(by turning their stuff into fed debt money quickly)

# Examples

- motor
- simple robot cart thing
- electric generator from hydro power
- living pod
- factory pod
- food growing pod
- bicycle/tricycle
- sky-hook-based freight system
- a boat


Lots of art is what is needed here.  Illustrator sucks for this.  Solidworks is not great.  Maybe what I want is a bunch of solidworks parts, then make images of those, then trace over those with illustrator, shading to create hand drawn illusion.  Maybe using the tablet will make this accurate even though I find it hard to use that pen.  How does the xkcd algorithm work?  Apply that maybe?  Look around on web, see if I can make or find a python script that converts files to "sketches"

also lots of photos, need to get "clean" pictures with good light etc, figure out this photo shop bullshit
