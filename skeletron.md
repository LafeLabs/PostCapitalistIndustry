# Section I: What is Skeletron?

Skeletron is the skeletal system of the technology.  There are many ways for a physical technology to have a skeletal system, but the one I choose for this work is based primarily off wooden sticks.  Finding a wooden stick and very similar bits of usable finished wood for free can be accomplished almost anywhere humans live.  

# How to Build

use of direct drive and motors to build power tools to shape it, how to scale, how to do 
various simple things like bearings, how to connect to other stuff

# Specification, medium of Exchange

This is a crude middle ground between the Value Circle and "money".  Skeletron elements with great art and more use can be traded as quasi currency along with simple elements and raw materials.  This creates some interface between our world and theirs and makes it easier to help people on the margins quickly in tangible material ways(by turning their stuff into fed debt money quickly)

# Examples

- motor
- simple robot cart thing
- electric generator from hydro power
- living pod
- factory pod
- food growing pod
- bicycle/tricycle
- sky-hook-based freight system
- a boat


Lots of art is what is needed here.  Illustrator sucks for this.  Solidworks is not great.  Maybe what I want is a bunch of solidworks parts, then make images of those, then trace over those with illustrator, shading to create hand drawn illusion.  Maybe using the tablet will make this accurate even though I find it hard to use that pen.  How does the xkcd algorithm work?  Apply that maybe?  Look around on web, see if I can make or find a python script that converts files to "sketches"

also lots of photos, need to get "clean" pictures with good light etc, figure out this photo shop bullshit
