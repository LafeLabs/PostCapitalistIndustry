16.	rotary water pump in a bottle
17.	3d shaper with a heat tool and 3 steppers
18.	water waves generator with strobe with tunable phase shift to see different phases of waves fixed in time


### Generators

1. spin a shaft with magnets by hand, observe the pickup signal
2. same but with step up transformer showing higher voltage
3. add a 3d fabricated bridge and capacitor circuit, look at the signal
4. add a regulator, look at the signal
5. power Arduino off of cap/regulator/transformer/rotor
6. build simple water wheel from bottle cap parts and run arduino from the creek
7. build a simple wind turbine and run the arduino from that
8. build a bigger water generator, run a motor from that
9. use the water generator to charge a LiPo battery
10. use the water generator to split water into H2 and O2, make a pop from ignition
11. make more step up transformers to get water wheel up to a few 10's of kV and show zap
12. water or wind runs LED, put guerrilla art up around

### Skeletron

1. Show finding wood, drilling holes, bolting together
2. show building a trash magic stick
3. Build a shelter

### random skills

1. show plastic welding
2. show 3d circuit fabrication with stones
3. show coil winding with a drill, by hand, with a crank, with a motor
4. finding rocks, bottle caps, etc
5. how to measure AWG of wire

### Electricity and fluids and plasmas

1. Show RC timer with a linear R and various C's and R's on UNO shield board
2. same with coil and L
2. show data for various liquids, prove that we can get NDR behavior
3. Ionize hydrogen using step up transformer, rotating magnet, and H2 from electrolysis
4. use magnet to drive fluid onto and off of electric contact, showing same NDR behavior with switching
5. colored fluids in clear channels demo
6. fluid flow measurements 


### Junk Car Feed

1. full automobile teardown, extract and tag parts, create tales and lore

### Nanotechnology

1. make tunnel junction from a soda can
2. STM with giant wheels to decrease motion from mm to sub nanometer
3. nanotube fabrication with dog shit methane reactor


### Demo Plan

Build about 100 demos for about 500 dollars over about a year and send them out to about 100 people.  These start the value circles.  Emphasis must be on *teaching* so that people expand the value circles exponentially as well as pass on the philosophy.  Protests might bring in hundreds in the course of a few days or weeks.  Some people will end up teaching hundreds and some will teach none.  Some will be teaching in a few days some after months.  How to estimate?  I want a million people in 10 years and a billion in 20 years.  Starting with 100 to get to 1 million I need to multiply by 10,000 in 10 years or 2.6x per year.  So if the goal is to teach 10 people who teach 10 people, and that replicates in a 3 month period, I could imagine an increase at peak of 10x every 3 months or 40x per year so that in 10 years it would be 40 to the tenth power or 10 quadrillion people, so clearly that's aiming too high!  To get a full 10 billion people in theory over 10 years the exponential growth rate needed is 10x per year.  So I need to teach 100 people per year and have 1/10th of them become people who can teach 10 per year, with enough variability on the up side.  The DNA of the spread technology must have code that mutates and expands so that the technology as it grows in number of people also grows in sophistication and power to take over all things.  10 per year is fourth root of 10 every 3 months is get a couple of serious people who can lead and teach every 3 months and 20 random people who do nothing.  

Value circles and value trees should be
