2. same but with step up transformer showing higher voltage
3. add a 3d fabricated bridge and capacitor circuit, look at the signal
4. add a regulator, look at the signal
5. power Arduino off of cap/regulator/transformer/rotor
6. build simple water wheel from bottle cap parts and run arduino from the creek
7. build a simple wind turbine and run the arduino from that
8. build a bigger water generator, run a motor from that
9. use the water generator to charge a LiPo battery
10. use the water generator to split water into H2 and O2, make a pop from ignition
