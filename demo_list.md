## List of Demos

### Motors and Pumps

1.	Single drive coil that drives a magnet with a button
2.	Single pickup coil to serial plotter
3.	Pickup coil to audio amplifier to speakers
4.	One pickup coil and one drive coil, resonant drive of many random things
5.	Two drive coils and one pickup coil for non resonant reciprocal action, splash water, move membranes
6.	four drive coils and two pickup coils rotational 4 pole stepper motor
7.	Same motor used to hoist a weight to show the power(force times velocity)
8.	Same hoist used to control a phone streaming video, so that user can control height and go up and down and look
9.	three motors make a xyz motion with fishing line or equivalent, again use a phone to do POV motion
10.	two motors turn two wheels on a wheeled robot with a phone streaming video so user can drive it around 
11.	All these parts with full object data including tales and lore and hand painted codes
12.	rotational motor turns a turbine pump inside a plastic tube
13.	rotational motor winds a coil, builds another motor


### Generators

1. spin a shaft with magnets by hand, observe the pickup signal
2. same but with step up transformer showing higher voltage
3. add a 3d fabricated bridge and capacitor circuit, look at the signal
4. add a regulator, look at the signal
5. power Arduino off of cap/regulator/transformer/rotor
6. build simple water wheel from bottle cap parts and run arduino from the creek
7. build a simple wind turbine and run the arduino from that
8. build a bigger water generator, run a motor from that
9. use the water generator to charge a LiPo battery
10. use the water generator to split water into H2 and O2, make a pop from ignition
11. make more step up transformers to get water wheel up to a few 10's of kV and show zap
12. water or wind runs LED, put guerrilla art up around
