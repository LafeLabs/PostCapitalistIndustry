# Coils for magnets and motors

## 1. Wire type

What kind of wire do you have?  Does it have a thick, opaque rubbery insulation or something closer to a varnish that allows you to see the copper color through it?  You want the latter.  Anything with thick insulation will cut down on your number of turns you can have for a given size coil, which is a serious drawback for magnet coils. 

So what gauge is your wire?  First, measure the diameter.  You can do this no matter how thing your wire is with an ordinary ruler by wrapping the wire around the ruler and pushing the wraps together.  Wrap until you have a full division of some unit filled.  It might be a quarter inch, and inch, a centimeter or a few mm depending on the size of the wire.  Just make sure you get a good number of turns.  To get the diameter you divide the distance by the number of turns and there you go!  If the wire is super thin, you will need many turns, but you'll still get a decently accurate measure of the thickness.  The units I recommend using are either thousanths of an inch, colloquially known as "mils" in the US, or millimeters.  Please do not ever call millimeters "mils".  That is used as thoustanths of an inch by too many people for it to work as a metric unit.  Just don't do it.  

Once you know the diameter, there are a couple things you want to do with that information.  It's not a bad idea to look up what gauge you wire is, just so you know and can compare to other people's designs or spec your artifact for other people to build.  In the US this means the American Wire Gauge, or AWG.  You want to know this if you want to be able to go buy more wire like whatever you're using on eBay later.  The table to look up the gauge is here:

There is one other key thing we want to know: the resistance per unit length.  This is temperature dependent but for now let's call it room temperature.
