## Cars are Death, Death to Cars

Cars are the enemy of humanity.  Every year in the US cars kill over 40,000 people, and maim countless more, similar to the *total* carnage for America of the entire Vietnam war which lasted many years.  Globally, the death toll is well over 1 million, or 10 million in a decade.  10 million dead.  

And that is just the beginning.  Cars are central to the industrial system which has crushed our humanity.   A huge amount of our oil based economy is used by the car system, adding to climate change massively, as well as bad urban air which kills millions worldwide.  Cars create a society in which anyone who cannot drive is disenfranchised, punishing anyone without perfect health and significant funds as well as the willingness to actively destroy the world and possibly kill living things just to get through their day.  Cars have filled up the USA with enough pavement to provide solar power to the entire nation(no small feat given our absurd energy consumption now).  Runoff of oil and other toxic chemicals leaks from cars into every water system in the world, poisoning every possible ecosystem.  

The companies that produce cars are some of the most evil on the planet.  Several of the major global brands, including all the German ones, have actively participated in genocide, an act for which they have never been properly brought to justice.  The endless stream of minerals required to feed the input end of the planned obsolescence conveyor belt also destroys the world in the ways that mining always does, with its usual disproportional impact on indigenous people around the world and on many other marginalized populations.  

In America and many other countries, car companies actively work to undermine democracy and civil society, campaigning to make sure society is built around the profits of their companies rather than basic principles of free movement of people. The ability to move from one place to another within a city for free should be a basic part of any social contract that people would actually consent to.  Car companies have built a society where there is no universal social contract in regards to mobility: all mobility is held hostage, under threat of violence, by a group of psychopaths(all car makers) who force all transport to make them money.  Even "public" transit is always based on giant machines made by the same monsters, and is deliberately priced high enough to make sure the poor pay at least as much per mile for getting around as those who have the money to buy into the car system.  Every time there is an economic downturn, the corporate backed local government will use that as an excuse to further crush the lives of the poor, raising fares and cutting services at the very time those without resources are likely to be the most desperate.  Again, this shows the fact that there simply is no social contract in the modern industrial city which all citizens consented to.  There is only the raw law of force: whoever has the most control of the industrial machines has the power of life and death over everyone else.  Of course the rulers dress this up in nice language about the "rule of law", but there simply is no such thing.  It's a costume raw force wears in our world. 

So the car companies and their collaborators in government are enemies, and cars form an almost living enemy of humanity world wide.  What should we do about this?  The Trash Magic answer is always the same: first find the trash stream(which always exists under capitalism since destruction is inherent in their ways) and then find ways to organically incorporate this into something good rather than bad.  

## Magical Answers!

And what treasure there is in cars!  Name any precious metal or special type of polymer or gas fitting or mechanical device and you can find them in a car.  A single automobile also has numerous computers of all kinds, which can be stripped and used for integration in our electronic systems.  And given the spectacular waste of the current system, cars really are free: while there is a used market for junk cars, it's clear that for society as a whole the global stream of junk cars, like other industrial waste streams, is a net liability not asset.  This negative value creates a global and ongoing opportunity for us to get the parts we need from it.  

Another advantage of using car parts for industry is the way in which the car is standardized.  There exist millions of units all over the world of certain popular car and truck models, and it can be possible to very accurately duplicate a complex design which uses parts from a certain make and model because of this.  

In particular, the parts of cars are great for building robots.  As discussed earlier in this work, robots in the right hands can have a fantastic positive impact on the human condition.  And this is really what this story is about: the robots built from cars which destroy cars.  If they are easy to build, and it's easy to *teach* people to build them, they can self reproduce, creating an exponential destruction vector through all cars globally.  

Robots must be designed and built and grown which first find cars, then rip them apart for scrap, then sort and catalog the parts, then reform them into more robots.  These can all be different kinds of robots, possibly used separately, possibly together, made by many people with many methods.  The point is they should be easy, and create positive value(unlike what the capitalists build, ever.)


## End Game: End All Cars

Destroy every single car.  rip out the individual atoms.  Rip them apart. Smash the engines, destroy any vestige to show that they ever existed.  Rip up the roads.  Build structures to live and work and grow crops in.  Make them all green, smash them but don't replace them with private property, this is a wedge to build more non private property space.

The end game is this: when the thing a car turns into after it ceases to be a car has greater value than even a functioning car, cars will start being consumed by our technical ecosystem even before the end of their capitalist lives.  As non-capitalist ways of living expand, the companies that make cars will be increasingly starved of the consumers they need to keep building and growing their death machines.  Eventually the companies will die and the existing cars will be destroyed faster than they can be made, eventually making the capitalist industrial system simply physically unable to keep making any cars.  Without enough car consumption to fund the corporate government, there will no longer be military force protecting roads and they can also all be ripped up for use by humans and other living things.  

## Free Lives Don't Need Cars

At this point, the capitalist will whine: "but without roads and cars how will I get around?"  First of all, you have to ask why you need to drive around all day in the current system.  Do you really need all that?  Do you need to go to an office miles away to do things no one needs done? 

No.  No you don't, and that's how all your errands are.  Errands are unpaid labor you have to do for industrial civilization.  Stop doing errands.  Stop working.  Build and grow what you need, then go have adventures as needed.  You should have everything you need for a good life, except adventure, within easy paddling distance of your main bathtub/bed.  You travel when you want to for adventure or when you are part of a larger migration which will use larger vehicles, mostly boats and giant spider pods, for moving whole populations.
