\subsection{Fourteenth Contemplation: Ion from
Earth}\label{fourteenth-contemplation-ion-from-earth}

In my extended version of the alchemy based world view, the cube
represents the element Earth and the sphere represents the element Ion.
For this, go out in the world with your coloring book, find a piece of
fantastic source material for the new world such as a rock, stick,
bottle, or dog turd. Stare at the thing, color in the ion emerging from
the earth and contemplate the emergence of new elementals from the old
as a new type of alchemy is born.
