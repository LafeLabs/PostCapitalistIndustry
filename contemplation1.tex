\subsection{First Contemplation: Pyramid of
Capitalism}\label{first-contemplation-pyramid-of-capitalism}

In the first contemplation we contemplate the evils of capitalism
through the lens of the pyramid, a universal symbol of that ideology.

Go out in your city and look at the ways capitalism worships itself.
Banks, giant office buildings of corporations, luxury hotels, old parks,
and court houses all show huge mounds of very precisely cut stone as
part of the system of worship of stone and order that we see in the
capitalist world. Go stare at them! Marvel at both how beautiful and
majestic they can be and how much evil the also symbolize with their
cold, impersonal stone. Note that these stone monuments are almost
always accompanied by surveillance cameras, a jarring reminder of what
they mean in our modern world.

The Contemplation can also be carried out at home by placing the pyramid
in front of a small capitalist artifact, playing the proper music, and
vigorously flopping around on the floor in ALL DIRECTIONS while
maintaining eye contact with the pyramid and evil artifact of capital.
