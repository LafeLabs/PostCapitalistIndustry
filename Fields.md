# Force and mass

Density field most tangible, the only field here with mass

# Electric Field, Voltage

E field from a charged ball, B field from a dipole, the concept of dipole, the mystery of the monopole 

must have visualization with phones here, van der graaf and other high voltage experiments, I should build a van der graaf, have design in appendix with motor in motor chapter, but have photos here with info on value circle method to get a vdg from someone else in the Network

# Electric Current and Charge

More applications of electric field, 

Here is where RC measurements first happen, learn about capacitance, or maybe that's the previous chapter?

# Magnetic field 

vector potential may be useful for our graphical approac, go back through the whole vector potential thing for magnetic dipoles

use of smarth phone to see the fields, use of pickup coil to see changing flux

# Pressure and velocity of fluids

# Temperature

do experiments, show platinum thermometer usage, smart phone usage
